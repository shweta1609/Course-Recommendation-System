The lectures were fine, and readings were a bit dry. However, the projects are very interesting and helped me to go in depth into the topics: buffer overflow, malware, cryptography and web security. The course involves some C, Python, JavaScript, HTML and PHP. Projects 1, 3 and 4 take some time to complete, so be sure to start early.\nThe TAs were very responsive and helpful in providing guidance on how to complete the project and giving small hints when students were stuck. Piazza was very active and helpful. Recommend as a first course or a summer course, even though the summer schedule is quite compressed (quiz almost every week, and project due every 2-3 weeks).','Medium','Loved!','10 hours/week'),('CS-6035: Intro to Information Security','rQ61CbkDbsUTGGMQhLnNoFa9IwK2','Solid','Easy','Liked','6 hours/week'),('CS-6035: Intro to Information Security','z0k64w4i49SKJyUkBsdQBcWJV4t2','Professor Lee was a no show on Piazza, which means the TA\'s ran the course. They did a decent job for the most part. Piazza wasn\'t particularly active and most of the interaction was via Slack. This meant that a lot of questions about the projects were repeated, over and over, in the Slack channels, along with a wave of activity just before a project was due.\nThe workload was very manageable. This was a summer course, and compared to the workload in GIOS, this required about half the effort.\nThe textbook is atrocious, and is designed to cram as many standards and terminology into the printed pages as possible. The quizzes are verbatim from the book, so you\'ll need it to do well there. Lectures were much better. The first half of the course is by Professor Ahamad, who rambles a little bit, but sets a nice pace for taking notes. The second half is by Professor Lee, who moves very quickly, and you\'ll need to pause the video if taking written notes.\nThe projects were the better part of the course, and covered topics such as stack overflows, malware analysis, encryption and web security. Most of them don\'t take a lot of work, but you\'ll likely get stuck and need to walk away for a bit. Therefore, you really shouldn\'t leave them for the last minute.\nUltimately, it\'s a decent introduction to Info Sec for a software engineer. If you are looking to specialize in Information Security as a Security Engineer, you\'ll need to supplement this class with additional training.','Easy','Neutral','8 hours/week'),('CS-6035: Intro to Information Security','QeYWbWRrbFVofK0jLnPMzB4xtbl1','If there is a reason to take this course, it\'s the projects. There are four projects where you get to experience how near-real-world information security attacks are carried out and how they can be mitigated, including buffer overflow, malware analysis, asymmetric keys, and XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection attacks. Many project tasks were very challenging and there were times where I was nearly pulling my hair out, but then you figure it out and you\'re on top of the world. The rest of the course felt somewhat rushed considering the summer semester schedule. This involved Udacity lectures (which I enjoy in OMSCS courses), textbook readings (you can just skim for quiz answers), 10 quizzes, and 2 closed-book cumulative exams. Overall the course was enjoyable and I learned a lot, though a good chuck of the information in lectures and the textbook I had already learned once in preparation for the CompTIA Security+ exam a couple years ago. Luckily this course brought back how this information is more useful to me as a computer scientist. The Piazza forum posts were primarily helpful when it came to working through the projects, and there were a number of helpful students on the Slack channel as well. The distributed office hours with TAs can be confusing at times (all live, there are no recordings), but by putting those in my calendar early on I was able to take advantage of a couple of them. I did think it was strange that the only thing that I witnessed the professor\'s involvement in was the lecture videos, so he must be a busy guy.','Hard','Liked','17 hours/week'),('CS-6035: Intro to Information Security','EaLcS6wqx5gUU6NTmd9MkYKNDzM2','There is a huge amount of reading and many long lectures you must do.

The lectures are alright. There are to professors that switch off depending on the topic. I find Wenke Lee\'s lectures to be very boring since he is just reading something word-for-word.\nQuizzes are pretty much pointless. The questions are taken straight from the book so they don\'t teach all that much. However, be sure to stay on top of the due dates because (at least in the summer) they can be a bit erratic.\nThe first project can be a bit challenging, but once you have that ah-ha moment it is pretty straightforward. Be prepared for writing reports for a few of the projects. The second project requires no programming but the first, third, and fourth projects require C, Python, and HTML/JavaScript, respectively.\nDon\'t expect the professor to make any appearances. Don\'t expect much from office hours since the TAs take turns running them, and most decide to have them on the Slack channel which I did not find useful since you couldn\'t post questions ahead of time and it was difficult to find the discussion later.\nI would reccomend this as a first course to take, a summer course, or as a course to pair with something more difficult.','Easy','Liked','3 hours/week'),('CS-6035: Intro to Information Security','bjFWOW0L9mcF5u2qOHZSSn3kpdD3','So this was my first summer course, and third overall course in the OMSCS program. Although I expect to receive and A, my feelings are very mixed about this class. On the one hand, three of the four projects were excellent (more on those in a moment). On the other, the quizzes and exams did not really seem to instill in me any huge amounts of security knowledge, and frankly I don\'t think they added much to the class at all.\nThe four projects covered security topics ranging from low-level stack overflows, to OS manipulations via malware, to RSA algorithms, all the way to basic web browser security exploits. Projects 1, 3, and 4 were the only parts of the class which required coding, and all were adequately challenging and thought-provoking to learn the subject material. Project 2 could use a refactor in my opinion, as it mostly revolved around utilizing a pre-existing security tool on a VM to search for specific exploit characteristics (by search I mean cntrl-F through a few webpages on the VM).\nAs far as quizzes and exams went, if you went through the relevant book chapters, made flashcards of all the bold-faced words, and studied those cards until each definition was burned into your head, you would probably do well enough. This effect could easily have been replicated in my opinion by just handing each student a document containing all those definitions, and utilizing the quizzes for this type of material. A far better approach to the exams would have been some sort of hand-written coding assessment detailing a security exploit, the reason why an exploit occurred, and its fix (very similar to the 4th project\'s written portion).\nOverall, the saving grace of this class were its projects. The lectures were also good.\nPS. From what I understand there is an extra-credit assignment worth 10 whole percentage points given ONLY in the normal Spring/Fall semesters. As the Summer semester did not have this assignment, I think a number of people expecting an easy A were a little surprised by the difficulty of the exams.','Easy','Neutral','10 hours/week'),('CS-6035: Intro to Information Security','zxPTQsZpQfaoaLT2N18XzVr2qb02','This was my third class and my first one during summer.

This course covers a survey of security topics, from software security to encryption to the business/practice side of security considerations. The material is not super deep, but I found myself getting very interested in a few of the topics and choosing to learn more on my own. The course consists of 10 quizzes, 2 exams, and 4 projects. The course schedule is provided from the beginning, so it\'s easy to plan your time in the course well.\nThe quizzes come nearly straight from the books and lectures, and are designed as more of a learning/review tool than something to punish you (each quiz was approximately 2% of the final grade). The textbook is not very great if you\'re trying to read everything, but I took the approach of printing off the quiz and using it to guide my reading. This worked fairly well. Exams are multiple choice, and also come mostly from the book and lectures. The exams are a level at which is difficult to make a high A, but pretty easy to make a C or higher with minimal lecture/textbook participation.\nProjects are pretty fun. There is some amount of written analysis for three of them, but it\'s fairly low key (not a formal report). You\'ll do things like use GDB debugging to find and exploit overflows in software, look at the effects of malware on a compromised computer, explore some website exploits like XSS and XSRF, and learn to break badly-implemented encryption. Overall there is not a lot of programming - only some minor Python code in the encryption unit and mostly what you\'re doing is implementing some mathematical functions provided in the lectures. You\'ll use some Javascript, SQL, and HTML in the web security project, but it\'s very minimal. Overall the projects are fun and do help the learning process. There was plenty of time to complete them, even in a summer term, and they count for a substantial portion of the grade.\nThe course was mostly run by TAs. The professor was largely absent, but it didn\'t really affect the course much. The material is survey level, and TAs were able to answer any questions that were had. TAs were competent, polite, and helpful. They responded fairly quickly on any issues that occurred in the course. The lecture videos were not very good - one professor was very long winded to the point of not caring anymore, and the other was very succinct to the point of not learning enough about the material. But it was good enough to learn what you need for the quizzes and exams, so it was fine.\nIt is pretty easy to earn an A or B in this course by simply following the course structure and turning things in on time. It is slightly harder to come out of it knowing the material well. I put in about 6 hours per week on average, not counting some side explorations I did on the material. My suggestion is to take the course and do everything, but leave some room to explore certain concepts more deeply on the side. You\'ll likely encounter plenty of things you\'re interested in and need some time to look further. This is a great course for pairing or low-stress summer work.','Easy','Liked','6 hours/week'),('CS-6035: Intro to Information Security','5F6gx1fHF9PV6bQUKaG8qlDXDuI3','I don\'t think the structure of this course has changed since it was created – 10 quizzes (20% of grade), 4 projects (60% of grade), 2 exams (20% of grade) – but I still enjoyed it. The book is quite dull, and has some repetitive content, but reading it is important for the quizzes and exams. Getting 100% of quiz points is easy but tedious, and I would argue that it\'s worth it for pushing your grade to an A. The exams don\'t do much to reinforce the content since it means drilling T/F and multiple choice questions, and some of the questions seemed out of left field. The head TA mentioned they are changing the exams for future offerings of the course, but I don\'t know what this means. The lecture videos are mixed - some interesting, and some just regurgitate the book. The projects are the most engaging part of the course, and do a good job of reinforcing some of the topics. There is so much time to complete each project, and I was able to do the work in a handful of days. I wished there were more of these practical exercises. Grading and feedback is fair, and the TAs are pretty active on Piazza, though the professor is not visible at all on the forums. The peer feedback for this semester was amazing, and anytime I was stuck on a project issue, my fellow students came to the rescue.

Just use the existing quizzes on Quizlet and you can get at least 70-75% on the exams just from that. (I didn\'t do the readings.)\nThe lectures are okay- they pretty much just summarize the content of the book.\nThe projects for the most part are worthwhile, but I feel like the grading is overly slanted towards getting very specific points correct. Project 3 in particular had an auto-graded section that I just bombed because multiple answers were dependent on getting certain hashed values correct. Came out with a B solely because of that project. I\'ve heard other semesters had extra credit offered, and it would be nice to have had that opportunity.\nOverall I would say this course is below-average. When you get things incorrect for the project, the grading isn\'t helpful about specifying what you should have done differently, which means that the course doesn\'t offer much as a learning experience beyond what is already accessible in any security textbook.','Medium','Disliked','3 hours/week'),('CS-6035: Intro to Information Security','DH8uzIKaclWKUDzx4ddvo2wz2RV2','Professor Lee is both absent with respect to course involvement and completely unenthusiastic in presentation of the lecture materials.

The biggest problem is that the projects often rely on gotcha-style insights orthogonal to the material being implemented, so you end up looking through dozens of examples of people doing similar hacks online, but since they aren\'t affiliated with the course, it\'s not dishonorable the way that asking someone to look at your code and point out what you\'re doing wrong would be.

I thought the 1st project, Buffer Overflow was the hardest if you don\'t have background in C and memory architecture. The 2nd, Malware Analysis, was very straightforward. The Cryptography project was also fairly easy since you don\'t have to write your own mathematical algorithms unless you really want to. (So you can make it more challenging if you desire by not using libraries.) Finally, 4th Web Security project definitely seemed very hard for those who had never done any web development.

I read most of the book, but overall I probably won\'t retain much since the book is dry and topics are quickly covered. I somewhat regret spending time reading since I don\'t feel I walked away from the reading with a really deep understanding, but rather with a surface level acquaintance with terminology to pass an exam.

A simple update on Piazza could have saved me, and probably many others, a lot of stress. I still stand by everything else I said below in the original review and edit 1.\nEDIT 1: As of May 4, I have to downgrade my review from \"liked\" to \"neutral\" due to some stressful communication issues. We were told on May 1 that all project 4 grades were expected to be returned later that night. Also on the night of May 1, we were told that the instruction team found out some students used past projects on GitHub to complete project 4. After this, the instruction team basically fell silent with very little exception. Like many others, I don\'t have my project 4 grade yet. I didn\'t cheat on project 4 or at all in this course, so the fact that I have neither my grade nor even the smallest relevant update from the instruction team is getting very frustrating and making me anxious, especially since it\'s now been 2.5 days since we heard anything relevant. I\'m sure I\'m not alone in this. My mind is racing at the thought of all the ridiculous hoops I\'ll probably need to jump through to fight a wrongful cheating accusation, and it\'s causing a lot of unnecessary stress. Take this course with caution.\nOriginal review:\nThis was a great course and was not too demanding. There are 10 open-book quizzes, each worth 2% of the grade. Almost every question is verbatim from the textbook or lecture notes. There are two closed-book exams worth 10% each. They were on par with the quizzes in difficulty, maybe a little more so since notes weren\'t allowed and they covered more material. The final exam was not cumulative. There were four projects, each worth 15%. The projects were some of the most interesting and fun I\'ve ever done in CS, as an undergrad or grad student. We had about a month to do each project, which is way more than necessary. For that reason, IIS is a fantastic course to pair with another course.\nProject 1 is all about buffer overflows. Knowing C helps a bit but is by no means a necessity. It\'s probably more important to know about internal memory architecture at a somewhat high level. This project was definitely the most time consuming for me, and I think I can objectively say it\'s the one with the most amount of work. (P4 might be more work if you have literally no web dev experience.)\nProject 2 is about malware analysis. I\'m not that interested in malware but I still enjoyed working on this project. It was a massive decrease in difficulty and workload from project 1 also. No programming required for this project; it\'s all with a tool in a provided VM.\nProject 3 is about cryptography. This one was awesome. Some basic cryptographic algorithm programming in Python. Previous knowledge of Python will absolutely be helpful, and even if you don\'t there is plenty of time to learn it before the deadline. A ton of guidance is given and a lot of the code is already provided.\nProject 4 is about web security and exploiting XSRF and XSS vulnerabilities, and doing an SQL injection. This one was extremely easy if you have previous HTML and JavaScript experience. There is some PHP code in the files we\'re provided, so it helps to know that a bit. But if you have previous programming experience then understanding the PHP code will not be an issue. Also, the only code we actually had to write ourselves for this is HTML and JavaScript.\nReally cool stuff. The textbook is dry AF and probably the worst part of the course. The lectures were so-so but informative. Mostly absentee professor on Piazza, but seriously, who cares? We learn material from the professors\' lecture videos, not from their Piazza posts.\nI definitely recommend taking this class.

They are like a series of puzzles to solve. They are very open ended, and the steps to complete them are left to the student to figure out, but generally speaking, you know when you\'ve got it right thanks to well defined completion criteria or provided test data to compare against. The first project requires GDB, which I\'d never used before. If you\'re comfortable with debugging in any language, this should be no problem. Knowing JavaScript, HTML, DOM, and some basics about how the event model works in a browser is very helpful for the last project. The weekly quizzes actually help learn the material because you can take them over and over. I took them at the beginning of the week, then looked for the answers while reading the text and watching the lectures. Then you can get a 100% by taking it again at the end of the week. There are two proctortrack exams that follow the same true/false and multiple choice format of the quizzes. They are not difficult, but some of the questions are poorly/awkwardly worded in a way that was frustrating.

The projects are less frequent at about one a month and are easier to figure out, especially when you have no background in the topic. I fell in this category for all of the projects so I averaged about 20 hours total a project between coding and writing the report. If you have significant experience in C with buffer overflows, or HTML/Javascript, then all of these projects can be completed in one night for you. The quizzes are straight from the lectures and book, so the book has great value for these. The tests focus on details and terminology from large amounts of chapters and lectures so memorizing that much information is the hardest part. The TAs and professor run the course very well and all our issues with Canvas will be figured out by the time later students take this course.\nI recommend this course as a great first course if you are coming from a technical background that is not computer science or engineering.

However, when it came to matters of policy and offering a cohesive message on things that came up, particularly in terms of graded content, there was no unified voice, and sometimes questions would go unanswered. There were some minor snags endured because the course switched from TSquare to Canvas but those were teeny and inconsequential. However, a few times, things that should not have mattered turned into frustrating issues because no one would address them.

They may overlap, but not necessarility.\nGrading is based on four take-home projects - which are just slightly related to what you see in lectures, ten open-book quizzes, and two closed-everything, one-hour proctored exams.\nThe projects are nice, and they\'ll force you to learn quite a bit on various security topics, but be aware: most of the time you\'ll be on your own.

The exams are a similar style. I was really excited for this class and was looking forward to getting exposure to information security. Now, at the end, this felt more like boring required courses from an undergraduate program. The weighting on the quizzes seems to be designed to \"force\" students to read and watch the lectures--which as a graduate student you should be doing anyway--but do not seem to be designed to enhance learning or reward students for being diligent. Overall, I would say unless you already have a background in Info-Sec--which would make the class trivial--or are looking to transition to security, avoid this class.

For example, the first assignment favored those who had a C-background while the last assignment favored those who were savvy with JavaScript. I would recommend doing a \'bonus\' project, preferably one which is geared towards your own skill set.\nLectures were split between Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee. Those given by Ahamad will literally put you to sleep. Lee keep a more brisk pace. I am not big into reading text books at all, but willed myself into reading this time due to many of the quiz (and therefore midterm and final) questions being pull from there. The quizzes are open book/notes and answers can easily be found online, but it is recommended to first attempt them without assistance since the midterm and final are closed book/notes.\nThe main reason that I took and would recommend this class is if you are going for the Computing Systems concentration. It fills that requirement nicely.','Medium','Neutral','12 hours/week'),('CS-6035: Intro to Information Security','9df6273c-3ac3-42a8-a73d-7732e0c1324f','This class had a lot of interesting material, but it was presented too quickly and shallowly.

As others pointed out, there is a large breadth of topics covered (and a corresponding lack of depth), which similarly has pros and cons.\nThe good: A lot of the topics are quite interesting, and if you are not a security person already, you will probably leave this class more aware of some area(s) of security that can help you in your career. The technical meat of some of the projects can be both interesting, challenging, and fun. They make it easy to get an A if you put in the effort.\nThe bad: Sometimes, getting started on the projects is hard for the wrong reasons (environment setup, somewhat lacking documentation for specific things, etc). It is nothing that one can\'t get past, but if you have limited cycles, those problems can at times be frustrating. The really unfortunate result of that was that it was the crack in the foundation of the class opened up the floodgates of incessant whining on Piazza. I understand a bit of grumbling about the project setup problems, but people started complaining about every little thing, when the reality was that most people probably did fine in the class. I truly believe that if we hadn\'t had those project problems, people would not have complained so much about other things. Sorry fellow students, but please make sure you are making a constructive comment before you reach for that \"anonymous\" button!\nThe ugly: As with any security class, you will leave realizing how insecure everything is. Good luck sleeping!\nSecret key to success: Buckle down and do the readings (don\'t just skim!). It will makes the quizzes and exams easier, and there is sometimes a deeper dive of content, or even non-overlapping content in the texts.

Start and finish the projects early as possible and you\'ll be alright. The tests, on the other hand, were at easy to fair level.

In the summer term, we read almost the entire book, and there were just under 18 hours of lectures. That being said, the material is broad and not very deep. This is definitely a survey course.\nGrading: For this term, 20% of the final grade comes from ten quizzes (open book/open note), 60% from four projects (equally weighted), and 20% from two exams (equally weighted). The exams are a midterm and final, and the final is not cumulative.\nThe projects: These took me from 6 to 12 hours each. The projects were:\nExecute a buffer overflow attack - make sure you\'re up on your C programming and have an intimate knowledge of how the OS lays programs out in memory.\nMalware analysis - we used a virtual machine to safely study malware. This project is basically following the instructions with no independent thought.\nCryptography - implement cipher block chaining, and search a keyspace to try to crack ciphertext. Your choice of Python or Java for the assignment.\nWeb security - launch a XSS, XSRF, and SQL injection attack against pre-supplied PHP code.\nAs you can see, these projects target different skillsets. You may have an easy time with one over the other.\nThe exams: There is very little required in the way of synthesis with the material, but there is a LOT of material to learn. The class average for the first exam was an 80. I\'m writing this before getting the results of the final exam.\nBonus project: the professors graciously allowed us a 10% extra credit project. Do it - it\'s fire insurance against a bad exam performance and can almost guarantee you the A.\nFinal verdict: this class was fun, and I learned a lot.

Most of them repeated or rephrased what was in the book. Not the best lectures I\'ve had so far, but not terrible either.\nHomework: There\'s a quiz portion to your grade. The quizzes are open everything and were taken verbatim from phrases in the textbook. To make the best use of them, it\'s best to read, watch lectures, and then attempt the quiz with everything put away. Afterwards, you can check your answers and submit.\nThe projects in this class were probably the best part. There are four projects that each focus on some aspect of computer security. Most required writing some code, while one consisted of analyzing malware. Each one took me 4 to 5 hours to complete, so not terribly hard. The project that dealt with finding vulnerabilities in a web application was the most fun. There were also some optional projects which could be used to bump up a low test or project grade.\nTests Tests were multiple choice and proctored. They didn\'t take too long to complete, and if you actually were doing the reading, they were fairly straightforward.\nGrading/Administration: The TAs were fairly active on Piazza. Grading seemed fair to me, with most projects auto graded. There were a few projects that had hiccups, but the TAs seemed to fix them within a few days.\nAdditionally, it was nice that the class offered optional projects.\nBook: The textbook for this class was interesting at its best, and extremely dry at its worst.

They are a bit challenging, require a good understanding of the concepts involved, and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time (~10-30 hours each).\nThe quizes and mid-term are basically regurgitations pulled verbatim out of the text at random. Quiz grades better reflect your ability to use the search function on the textbook PDF rather than an understanding of the concepts. The closed book mid-term had a median grade of 77. It is difficult not because of the material, but because the grader is looking for matches to random statements from the text book.

You will spend most of your time researching and learning the various internal and external APIs rather than programming anything cool. The code for the APIs are extremely messy and extremely difficult to work with in my opinion. Also, there are a limited number of submissions that can be made to Bonnie per day which makes it more difficult to test your programs.

She knew the ins and outs of every assignment, and held weekly office hours.\nProfessor Ada and the TAs were transparent about why they weighted the exams and assignments the way they did, and how they graded. They were also understanding with regards to Bonnie issues, and the TAs helped us out with local testing.\nDeadlines for the first two projects were extended.\nIt was a very collaborative environment. Students helped each other out with enthusiasm. The interop testing especially in Project 1 was very useful.\nResource recommendations were excellent: I will likely continue to refer to OSTEP, The Linux Programming Interface, and Beej\'s Guides in the future.\nThe instructors actively solicit feedback for every project, and this shows in the quality of the projects. The projects came with clear instructions in a readme, helpful tips, and no mistakes in the code. I liked that we were required to document our approach and think about ways to improve each assignment. This enhanced my understanding and retention of what I learned while doing the project.\nI wish we could have gotten our grades and feedback for Project 2 before taking the final. Perhaps hiring more TAs would help, but maybe the class budget is constrained for summer semesters.\nI also have difficulty learning from video, without an accompanying textbook. I was grateful for the class-compiled transcripts, but it was a bit hard to follow since it was just verbatim. I liked OSTEP and The Linux Programming Interface, but to do well on the exams, we really have to focus on what is presented in lecture.

The projects were basically creating multithreaded HTTP and file servers, parsing network packets, and calling RPC servers - projects that I would expect in a networking class. I was expecting projects more along the lines of writing a simple, primitive OS? Maybe these projects are in the next class (AOS)?

Coming into this I was hoping for a solid introduction to OMSCS, computer science, and C and I would say that it was very successful on all fronts. I’ve consolidated my thoughts / tips about the class below based on topic.\nProjects\nThe project code always contains a base set of functionality which you enhance. PR1 for example gives you most of the code for a working C program, you just need to cover the business logic (creation/parsing of a GETFILE protocol message).\nTA’s always provided the CMakelists file if you prefer to use CLion and that also makes things easier.\nPR1 – GETFILE PROTOCOL\nI had very little C experience before this and I was a bit scared coming into the first project. Consequently, I began PR1 as soon as I could and finished about two weeks early. I spent a lot of time in the beginning establishing best practices for how to do things. It forced me to work slowly and do a ton of research on various C aspects, but by PR3-4 I was very confident in my C ability.\nPR2 – Extra credit research project\nI went above and beyond and did the experiments, which was not required. It took me about 4 hours to complete.\nPR3 – Shared memory-based IPC\nThis one was pretty easy for me. I completed it in about 6 hours total, including both parts.\nPR4 – RPC\nThis program is basically PR1 and PR3 where RPC abstracts all of the communication. It’s pretty easy, but took me about 12 hours to complete because I stumbed on the MT section.\nKnowing C\nI was completely new to C coming into this and excited to get some exposure. The first project will force you to use strings. Working with strings in C can be challenging. If you\'re like me and eager to learn new lower level languages, this class is perfect for you.\nThe other thing that was pretty complicated was the implementation of a thread pool. You don\'t have to do it like this, but in terms of performance its the best way. Once you get a working thread pool implementation, you can use it for subsequent projects in the class.\nTests\nTest 1 – 25% of your grade. I found it harder than the second exam. Median was a 76%.\nTest 2 – 30% of your grade. IMO, it was easier than the first exam by a long shot.\nTAs\nOverall, the TAs were highly responsive, but very shame based. I suppose it’s an industry problem. The expectation is that you know the readme very well. Questions about well defined things on the readme or C related questions you can google will get you ridicule. Always try to find the answer on your own before you ask.\nTips\nUse the study guide to study for the test. It seems obvious but, I studied everything I could get my hands on for the first test and felt like I made it much harder on myself. I found that other students were doing similar things. Since this is an introductory class, there are certain topics in which the rabbit hole goes deep. Make sure that you’re studying the material as it relates to GIOS.\nI would strongly recommend using CLion. They make an IDE for every language used in the OMSCS program and its heavily used in the industry. I ended up installing this on my Ubuntu VM and using it from there.\nThere is a slack for this class and I would recommend it. The TA’s are very responsive.\nI would recommend the environment setup they use. I tried doing PR1 on my mac and had all sorts of problems.\nFor debugging, there are a few tools which will make your life easier. I found these to be most helpful:\nTelnet – must have for the first part to test your server before you finish the client\nWireshark – to confirm whether client or server is breaking\nCLion debugger – self explanatory\nThere is always a performance metric component to the test. These are based on the readings assigned during the semester. Know those very well, it’s low hanging fruit on the exam.\nExecution flows are a big part of this class. If you don\'t understand the math, I strongly recommend that you draw out the flow. The questions on the test are usually small enough that you can draw them out to achieve the answer. This is what I did for test 1 and 2 and it worked out well.\nAt the end of the class, they added a lot of material and I felt like the amount of time required increased per week. Take this into account after the midterm and stay on-top of your lectures.\nSome of the last readings are unnecessary and very long. The RPC reading, for example, is unnecessary, dense, and 40 pages long. Since it was not present on the study guide, I skipped reading it altogether and it paid off.','Medium','Loved!','12 hours/week'),('CS-6200: Intro to Operating Systems','7OXexWMRhQh9wboLIdTV3MyL8br2','This course was very challenging for me because I did not have any prior experience with C (despite all of the warnings).

I would definitely not recommend following the approach that I did though by thinking I could pick up C on the fly; as far as I can tell, I spent way more time on the projects than most of my peers, and most of that time I was way out in left field anyway. If you\'re still determined to take this course without knowing C first (hey I get it, I was stubborn too), then do yourself a favor and go pick up a copy of The Linux Programming Interface (I found one pretty cheap at a local used books store) right now, because it\'ll be your lifesaver for the first few projects.\nThat said, even though I really struggled with the programming assignments, I still really enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot from it.

I came into this course with plenty of C knowledge, and I thought I understood Operating Systems concepts well (turns out I did not). I would say with my background, this course is more like a medium difficulty because of the amount of content, but for those new to C or OS concepts, I suspect it would be quite hard. That said, it is an achievable course, and with the generous curving policy it does not aim to make your life difficult. If you complete the work and give the class a fair shot, you will probably earn a B. Earning an A takes a bit more work.\nProjects are described in better detail on other reviews. With my C background, Pr1 took about 10-12 hours, Pr2 took about 4-6, Pr3 took about 8, and Pr4 took about 5. I would say they are difficult, but at no point did I feel like I was lost without any clue what to do next. If you reference the readme, make use of search functionality in Google, Piazza, and Slack, and when that fails, ask relevant questions, the projects are quite achievable without any existing C knowledge. But I will admit they would be quite difficult if you haven\'t been exposed to much C. I would say you could double or triple my times if you\'re trying to learn C along the way. It would be a good way to learn C, for what it\'s worth.\nExams are difficult. I thought I understood OS material already, but the course went much deeper into how things work under the hood. It does a good job of exposing you to important academic research in the field, and gives you some of the early building blocks of how things came to be. The exams are multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank for calculations, but they are far from easy. You will not do well if you haven\'t absorbed the lecture material and given the paper readings a fair shake. The exams are both quite fair, though. The practice questions provided give you a very good view of what will be on the test, but again, they are not easy.\nThe course makes it very easy to participate. A TA has opened up a private paid slack instance which to me was invaluable this semester. It allowed many people a place to get more instantaneous help with projects and material, as well as get to know each other and create decent relationships, for an online program. If Piazza isn\'t your thing, this is a great resource to have. Either Slack and Piazza participation counts for a small portion of the final grade, but there are plenty of opportunities to contribute.\nMy advice on this course would be to brush up on basic C concepts, and hit the ground running. Use the first week to get ahead on lectures and readings, so that when the first project comes out you can start work immediately. The only people I observed struggling with it to the point of not completing it were those who started it halfway through the deadline. There is generous time given to complete the projects, which makes it ripe for procrastination, but do not. I would also advise you to get ahead on the second half of the course - the material on the final is about 2 times the content of the material on the midterm, so work quickly through that material to allow plenty of time to review for the final.\nIf you come in with some interest in the subject, it is a very rewarding course. I like that it doesn\'t hold a grade over your head, which helps with enjoyability... but you do have to do the work to obtain it. In my opinion it makes an excellent first course, as it is well-run, the TAs are available and helpful, the professor actively participates despite the large class sizes, and the projects are well put together and help expand on the material you learn.','Hard','Loved!','13 hours/week'),('CS-6200: Intro to Operating Systems','UFB2PrD13ShvuWoPKPYbzTbdnmy1','Great class.

I felt like the grading breakdown was fair, with ~50% projects and ~50% tests. There are extra credit opportunities. The professor and TA\'s are all very active on piazza and slack; probably one of the most active in the courses I have taken so far. This is great because questions get answered very quickly.

It did take significant effort up front to understand the requirements of the projects. You can do this class without C in you skillset, but you will spend 10+ hours a week the first half of the course catching up on it because the projects require it.

Due to my efforts catching up on C and taking another class, I did not get to dive into the material as much as I would have liked. One thing that I wish the class provided was more assignments related to the readings. Whether essay or simple quizzes, I think it would help students take more from this material to have it tested in more than just the two exams. Only half the readings relate at all to the projects.

The TA\'s for this class are amazing and will always help you. They don\'t give you answers but they can point you down the right path. We had other students in the class with experience in some of the areas and they helped out in Piazza and in the Slack channel as well. Between the projects, TA\'s, and other students, there is a huge wealth of knowledge to gain in this class.

The instructor held weekly office hours to answer any questions about the projects, lectures, papers, or tests.\nProject 1 is really not that bad if you keep it simple, which is harder then it sounds when you\'re new to this subject. Its easy to over think the problem and create a mess but the project is really pretty straight forward. One of the main focuses of the project is multi threading.\nProject 2 was extra credit for us. It had no programming but was a written assignment to design an experiment.\nProject 3 was the toughest. It was a bit more free form in that you could design your program to work many different ways. Its best to plan this project out before you start programming it. I jumped right into programming and that was a mistake. I still did very well on the project but I could have saved myself many hours if i would have designed before programming. Shared memory and multi threading are some focuses here.\nProject 4 was the easiest. Again its really straight forward but I can see it being another project that is easy to over think and make difficult for yourself.

I had taken an undergraduate course in Operating Systems years ago, and this blew it out of the water in terms of depth and breadth. You\'ll get to learn about some low level, classical OS material and get into more modern ideas supporting concurrency, virtualization and distributed systems. Some of the lectures are pretty dense, so you\'ll probably want to watch them in pieces rather than all at once. There were 3 projects and an extra credit project this semester, and they were all in C. If you don\'t know C already, this is where the bulk of your difficulty in the class will come from. Some of the code templates given used syntax and operators I\'d never seen before, and this created a lot of difficulty for me. If you\'re well versed in C and navigating Linux man pages already, you\'re probably fine. Exams were tricky, but I didn\'t find them exceptionally hard despite their reputation. The course is curved, and the boundaries seemed pretty generous. If you mess up more than one project you can still walk away with a B if your exam scores are above average.\nTAs are pretty responsive on Piazza, but don\'t rely on them to help you at the last minute - ask early and you should be good. Project grades take a long time to return, but this semester had an unusually high number of students so I kind of expected this going in. Make sure to pass Bonnie tests - they seem highly correlated with the end grade of your projects.\nThere was also a very active course Slack this semester where you can get fast help if the TAs are online. Professor Gavrilovska holds office hours every week (not just the TAs), so you can get help there too.

I saved myself many hours just by doing some cursory scanning of the issues that others were running into on their projects. The TAs that were active in the slack channel were generally helpful as well.\nI feel overall the course was paced very well with ample time to do projects (assuming you don\'t procrastinate too much). Personally, I feel the exams aren\'t that great probably because they need to resort to a lot of multiple choice, true-false in order for the tests to be gradable.

I say best in term of the rich amount of material that\'s covered in the lectures and projects which further reinforce (THREE projects + 1 extra credit project offered but optional) the theory. The class will require you to work very hard to complete the projects. They give you starter code and a description of what\'s expected. You will find yourself googling how to do things like setting up TCP sockets or using Shared Memory IPC etc. A good background in C will help in this course as all the projects require using C language. Slack and Piazza are good places to look for answers / ask when you are stuck; 7/10 times someone else has already asked the question.\nTo prepare for C, read and practice some examples on Arrays, Pointers (understand pointer arithmetic also), Structures, Function Pointers (used to do Callbacks), Dynamic memory allocation and freeing using malloc() and free().\nUbuntu operating system is used for the projects. I used Virtual Box to run Ubuntu but perhaps my computer is sluggish and the VM was annoyingly sluggish. I would recommend running it natively off of a partition if you can. I have two monitors but could only use 1 with VirtualBox, I could look into enabling the 2nd monitor but I didn\'t even try considering how sluggish it already was.\nThe exams were challenging but fair. If you go through all the lectures and understand the content and do the quiz examples and sample exam, you will be prepared for the exam. It is a lot of content so do keep pace with the schedule while working on the projects.

I come from a mechanical engineering background, with only done 1 C project over a year ago during my senior year embedded computing class and capstone project. I\'ve done some self-studying and programming at work, so not completely disconnected from the programming world.\nI knew that I would struggle a bit to understand and relearn C so I gave myself extra time to do the projects (START EARLY) and stay consistent with a strict schedule. With a full time job and no kids, this class was my life for these few months.\nOne key thing I struggled with in the beginning was to set up your environment. They say there are a bunch of ways to do it and you can do it however you would like, but from a beginner\'s perspective and not knowing anything about how to set up an environment, I would have appreciated it if they had ONE default suggestion. After a week or two of struggling to get a proper environment set up, I finally found a working environment. I used VM VirtualBox to install Ubuntu (which they should have instructions/find instructions on internet), then for IDE in Ubuntu I used VisualStudio Code. This IDE was great because I figured out how to do debugging (there is a youtube video on debugging with VSC in Ubuntu), and you can debug with multiple VSC windows, essentially stepping through multiple interacting programs (debugging client AND server at the same time).\nA tip is to be active on the Slack channel. It can be difficult to keep up with all the activity going on, but if you put in the time and effort, you can sometimes gain some really helpful pointers and tips. That is why it is recommended to really start early and find your problems/roadblocks early, and you can be on the lookout for a solution in the Slack channel. To get the most out of the Slack channel, I learned that you need to be very precise with the wording of your questions and try your best to communicate that through text. That will allow the TA\'s or students to better help answer your questions. Don\'t be afraid to ask your questions, but be specific and think about how to phrase it in a way for other people to understand (explaining code and technical stuff through text can be very confusing and difficult).\nAnother tip is try to meet up with students locally. Having someone to talk to and discuss project ideas and course concepts is VERY helpful. Of course please beware of plagiarism and misconduct according to the course rules.\nProjects were absolutely great! Coming from someone with very little C programming experience, I had so much to gain. Of course they might change the project contents every semester, but our semester it was fair amount of work with the given time. The first project was the most daunting because everything was so foreign to me. The VM, which IDE to use, how to debug, socket programming (concepts I\'ve never done nor was it taught in the videos); it was overwhelming at first... so START EARLY. Project 3 was by far the most fun (get a whiteboard) with the design aspect. Project 4 was the most difficult to wrap your head around, but once you figure it out, you will say: \"What that\'s it?...\"\nIf you finish the projects and pass all the automated tests with a decent readme, you should be able to get 100 on the projects. I did right at average for the midterm, and a little below average on the final (disappointed with my performance), but I surprisingly got an A in the course!\nAll in all, in my opinion this was a perfect first OMSCS course.

There are 3 projects, beginning from simple echoing server to a server that does some sophisticated jobs like receives a file from a client, do requested work, and send back the result to the client where both server and client are multithreaded. If you are not familiar with these programming concepts, it will take time to understand and do the first project even if you have used C for different applications.\nAs this class declares itself as intro, the lecture covers pretty wide range of topics. Watching 1 Udacity lecture video took me about 3 to 4 hours. There are 4 to 6 lectures per part and there are total 4 parts, you can calculate how much time you have to pay for watching Udacity videos. I recommend you to keep notes for every video otherwise you will not find relevant materials when preparing for the exams. I kept notes with MS Word and I spent about 4 pages per lecture.\nThe workload I specified (==10hr/week) is the peak load when there is a project. I spent average 2 hours a day for a whole week to complete the project before the due date. If you are smart and can find an easy way to implement the problem, then it should be shorter. If you are going in the wrong direction, you will spend the whole week for debugging. When there is no project due, I recommend spending some time to follow the Udacity videos. It is quite long.\nThe instructor gracefully provides an expected question set for each exam. It is a shared google doc and students are encouraged to collaboratively fill the form. You can see other students\' answers so you will find it very useful. There are two exams, midterm and final.

Since this is now my 9th course in OMSCS I\'ve certainly run the gamut in terms of quality of courses. That being said, I\'d say IOS is one of the better ones (my favourite and best being KBAI) for the following reasons:\nThe video lectures are well organized, the concepts are explained clearly, and quizzes are thoughtful and helpful in reinforcing topics.\nInstructor and TA involvement was exceptional in Piazza. They fostered a collaborative learning environment which helped bring learning above and beyond just the video lectures\nThe projects were helpful and fun to do. As rusty as I am in C, the projects were a nice refresher and departure from my usual day-to-day work in higher level languages. If you start early on the projects and get involved with class discussions, there\'s no reason you shouldn\'t succeed on the projects. There are also plenty of extra credit opportunities that weren\'t hard to complete and ended up saving my grade.\nMy concerns with this class:\nExams: although mostly straightforward, they were tricky and sometimes required remembering one small lecture detail. The midterm and final exam weren\'t evenly split over lecture material with the final covering significantly more lectures. In this regard, I highly suggest that you keep pace with the class syllabus.\nGrades: We received our project 1 and midterm grades back fairly quickly, but didn\'t get project 3 grades (which was due in the middle of the semester) until nearly after the final. Not having a good pulse on your grade was mildly frustrating.\nBonnie: Project submissions are handled through Udacity\'s testing framework, Bonnie, which had a few hiccups throughout the semester which were eventually resolved. I did like the instant feedback it provided.\nHow to succeed and other advice:\nKeep up to pace with lectures, projects, and reading material. With regards to the reading material especially towards the final, I found that just focusing on the papers that were discussed in lecture were most important. There were some lengthier papers that, although interesting, contained far more detail and concepts than the class exams or projects required.\nI bought the Silberschatz Operating Systems Concepts textbook but only cracked it open once or twice because the lecture material was complete in itself and Piazza was an excellent supplement for answering questions. I regret buying the textbook, but YMMV.\nInvest time in setting up and understanding your C development environment. It will save you time in the long run when you\'re trying to debug a segfault. Use an IDE like CLion (free for students). It helps highlight syntax errors that you could otherwise miss. Learn the basics of vagrant (virtual machine), valgrind (memory leak checker), and gdb (C debugger).\nOverall I\'d rate this course an 9/10 and would highly recommend it.

The class was a good introduction to a lot of OS concepts, and gave a decent survey of more modern concepts that many would consider to be application or domain-specific (e.g. data centers). The material was lopsided in that the final part of the semester was much more in-depth than the beginning, and hence the final exam had many more pain-points of memorization than the midterm. The projects were very illustrative of the concepts (I wish we\'d had project 2, whatever that was) and didn\'t fall into the trap of being application-specific. Strongly recommend C programming background, familiarization with GDB, and (probably) a solid understanding of the Linux filesystem and make paradigm.

As all great things it did have its ups and downs.\nIn this class you will learn about: processes and process management, threads and concurrency, scheduling, memory management, inter process communication and various sync constructs, i/o, virtualization, remote procedure calls, distributed file systems, distributed shared memory, and some datacenter technologies.\nYou will get to implement a multithreaded getfile client/server, proxy, cache, and play with an RPC (this semester\'s was Sun\'s RPC) think how awesome all of these would look on your resume, also you\'ll be able to answer all of the AOS prereg question list https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/cs6210_diagnostic-preparedness-test.pdf. If your goal is to eventually take AOS, HPC, HPCA then this class would get you in great shape for them.\nThe lectures are great and require no outside readings to understand the material, professor Ada was very active on Piazza and held office hours regularly, and the TA\'s were friendly and very responsive on both Piazza and Slack.\nThe tricky part of the class were the exams, particularly the final which had more material than the midterm on it. So I suggest you study hard for it. There are some (few) papers to read through, but you can get through these fairly easy as there\'s few and concise.\nKEY to this class is to make sure you start the projects on time, the first project in particular is trickier than the others. The more time you spend on it and the better you do on this first project will be worth it in the long run. For each of the projects you have about 1 month to complete which is more than enough. I didn\'t do as good on this first project, because I started it very late, but managed to do good on the last two. So even if you don\'t do as good on the first one don\'t fret, you can still do great in the class!\nSome C will be good to know coming in, but I think that if you work hard you can pull it off with minimal knowledge, you just need to attack that first project really hard. If you\'re familiar with pointers, double pointers, function pointers, and using typedef and structs, then you\'re golden. If not then take the Lynda.com C classes (comes free for students) or grab the K&R C book and go through it (there\'s also a k&r c solutions book that can be bought for the solutions for the exercises) you can get those for under 20$ if you look hard enough, but just understanding the aforementioned will be enough and wouldn\'t take more than a few days of stack overflowing and testing on your own to get.\nMake sure you\'re on Slack since Day 1, you can learn a lot about the projects and get hints on them by lurking in the channels. This semester we had a PAID Slack workspace thanks to one of the TA\'s, how cool is that? To top it all this semester there were some pretty funny characters on it which made lurking enjoyable, however there\'s always the usual troll tho in there, but hey it\'s still a great resource.\nTL;DR: Just go for it; great class, doable/rewarding projects, friendly/active TA\'s, very active instructor, very C, such Threads, many Science, WOW.','Hard','Loved!','20 hours/week'),('CS-6200: Intro to Operating Systems','JEWVoIaG5hTCdx2OvR94Z3rvxJd2','There were a lot of great things about this course and a few things that could use improvement. The great things are the lectures are engaging, the assignments are relevant to industry, and the course staff was engaging on Slack and Piazza. The things needing improvement I felt were the assignment count and one or two questions on the exams. The first assignment and the third assignment were both rather difficult so you want to get a start on those as soon as you can. The fourth assignment was not as difficult so that was a great time to take advantage of the extra credit in the class. If you bomb the hard half of project 3 like I did, you\'re going to have a hard time bringing up your grade for the remainder of the course due to the lack of assignments .That\'s unfortunately enough to sink you with assignment 2 gone. However, with the curve, its still rather attainable to get a B (I received a B). The exams were rather difficult and tricky. Most of the questions were fine. I felt that one or two of the questions were cheap shots (obscure details in papers that aren\'t immediately obviously applicable to industry /historical ). I went over the videos over and over again but honestly still didnt do very well here. Definitely focus on understanding the details in the assigned papers and don\'t put the papers off until after the assignments were due like I did (this was a mistake).

The TAs are basically grading that you followed the guidelines more so then actually pass/fail the projects.\nThe lecture material was good a lot of subjects that were covered was not covered in my undergrad OS class.

There are 3 projects and all required C programming. I expected this class is for OS internal and it is partly correct but it spends much time on concurrency problem (a process and a thread) while it is still very fun.\nI felt the latter half of lectures are bit dry, and because we don\'t have hands-on experience on them (memory management, file structure, spin-lock, hardware related subjects, and memory sharing) through projects, it was bit difficult for me to understand and absorb all of what I was taught.\n20 hrs / week is just average and I always tried to complete a project as soon as possible, so after a project is open, I spent 70-80 hrs / week and after I completed it, I go back to lectures and spent 10-15 hrs /week.

However they kindly offer a check list you should review before each exam, so by checking all of them, going through all quiz on lectures and sample problems, I think you can be ready for tests.\nAnd if you want A, you should definitely try to get all extra credits.

The lecture content is somewhat dense at times but Ada does a great job of explaining concepts and I found her lectures extremely useful. There are two exams that are certainly tough but you only need to study the lecture material to do well on them. I\'d recommend reading the assigned papers but the main concepts from them are also covered in lecture and I didn\'t bother to re-read them while studying for exams. This approach netted me above average scores on both exams which largely contributed to my A in the class.\nThere are three projects whose difficulty will depend on your familiarity with C. I came into the class with no C experience and definitely had my struggles on the first project, but I managed to power through it and felt far more comfortable for the rest of the class. Despite this I\'d caution against taking this class with little/no C experience unless you consider yourself a strong programmer, otherwise you may be in for a rough ride. The first two projects are both difficult and time consuming and I would start them as early as possible because you are going to run into issues with C/Bonnie/etc along the way. If you manage to get through those you\'ll find that the last project takes significantly less time. The good news is that you have access to the autograder (Bonnie) for all projects so you generally know what grade you\'re going to get when you turn the project in. I put significant effort into the projects and got full points on all three, though I know students got docked minor points for poor READMEs and other small things.\nYes this class is hard and you\'re going to get frustrated during the projects, but your efforts will be rewarded by a solid foundation in operating systems and you will no longer fear C.','Hard','Loved!','20 hours/week'),('CS-6200: Intro to Operating Systems','PFvtnvcN38WJuJt1LjfFwr7Xzqj2','What an amazing course!

This course provided a nice introduction to these concepts, at least to a point where I know where to look for for more information. It is not as detailed as a standard OS course at a top-tier school, though. For example, in my undergrad school, I know that CS majors had to actually write an OS from scratch as the project for this course. This course only requires us to use some of the OS features to implement some applications. This course covers a breadth of information in an easily ingestible way. But it does not go deep into any of the concepts.\nBasic knowledge of programming is absolutely necessary. If pointer, references and SIGSEGVs scare you, this course is probably not for you.

My background - technical undergraduate degree (non-CS, a little programming), web developer for 3 years using higher-level languages, and read \'The C Programming Language\' as I was starting the course. Experience with the course - this course requires a decent time commitment, both for projects and for keeping up with lectures. Most weeks had 3-4 hours of video for lectures, and I worked steadily on projects every week, making sure I kept up with recommended benchmarks so I didn\'t fall behind. Not being familiar with C meant that I did a decent amount of googling for basics (and referring back to my book), and I also requested help [moderately] often from the slack channel. However, most of my problems were not strictly due to lack of language familiarity (the homeworks do not demand anything that complicated in terms of C) - more often I was confused about the concepts or made silly mistakes due to lack of confidence.

I had very little general programming experience (no industry experience, some C++ in undergrad, and some Python scripting). The first two projects took me about 50-80 hours each, I\'d wager.\nTESTS: There is no required text for this course, and all you get for material are lecture videos and papers. So studying for tests consisted of watching videos over and over for me. The tests themselves are kind of vague, but they are achievable, and you will learn a lot studying for them, but I would like to see more concrete test questions with less subjectivity. One \"project\" was a take-home quiz, where you decide on test parameters for some fictitious experiments. This one was super vague, and I would have much rather actual ran experiments and written a paper.\nLECTURES: I don\'t know if this is true about all OMSCS videos, but she waves her hand a lot in front of the screen, which causes the text to be projected on her hand. Not a big deal, but I found this distracting. I ended up watching the lecture videos over and over, because that seemed to be the best way to pass the tests. Would rather have been pointed to more reading.\nOVERALL: My first course in OMSCS. I think this class was great and was not too hard, even without much programming or OS experience coming in.

Avoid my mistakes and start early. Each of those projects should be an easy A, if you\'re careful with your time and ask for help.\nThe tests, on the other hand... There are two and they jointly account for 55% of the grade. They are also pretty tricky IMO, so take \'em seriously.

There are also often a few extra credit points you can get on most assignments, but usually you need to be to complete the main part of the project before attempting the extra credit.\nThere are only two exams: the midterm and the final, and they both cover a lot of material and are worth a pretty large percentage of your grade. Even if you remember all of the material, you have to be able to understand it and apply it in new ways on the exam. The questions are either multiple choice, check all that apply, or fill in the blank. I recommend taking thorough notes while watching the lectures to prepare and asking questions on slack or piazza when you need clarification.\nTo succeed in this course, I recommend not procrastinating, especially on projects 1 and 3, and once again taking good notes on the lecture material.

I recommend you at least take some intro to c course, and definitely review c strings (and what the str* functions do vs mem* functions), and pointer management, and the difference between c strings and buffers.

The TAs here spend considerable effort at discovering and pursuing cheaters, on both projects and exams. They take this issue very seriously and managed to catch many.

I\'d also recommend going through the free online book \'OS: Three Easy Steps\' (it\'s pretty short, and there are exercises that go along with it). If you do this, I think you\'ll get a lot more out of the course.\nLectures: With a couple of exceptions, the videos are good but can be pretty abstract. The most enjoyable lectures were the ones that tied into the projects very obviously. You can get away with only watching the videos, but for a fuller understanding you will need to read the recommended textbooks and do a fair bit of googling.\nProjects (40% of your grade): I found the first project very difficult indeed, and I think this is one of the reasons why this class has such a high dropout percentage. However, if you can mash your way through project 1, then you should be able to get to the end of the course with a good grade, as projects 2 and 4 are much easier. Project 3 required a few late nights too, but at this point you should be better at C. Start early on P1 and P3, and do not underestimate them.\nExams (55% of your grade): The two exams (midterm and final) are short, and while I found the midterm relatively easy, the final exam covered a lot more material and was acknowledged by most of us to be pretty difficult.

The instructors and TAs were readily available and concerned with students learning the material and being able to make it through. The lectures and papers covered a lot of material, particularly after the midterm, so it pays to stick to the schedule even when there are no firm deadlines. Two of the four projects (1st and 3rd) can be quite time-consuming, particularly if you aren\'t strong in C. I found the grading to be fairly lenient on the assignments. About 2/3 of the material happens after the midterm, making the final challenging. There were several extra credit opportunities, and the instructor indicated that there would be a fairly healthy curve on the final grades, so there is room to make mistakes and still get an A.\nThe one weak spot of the course, in my mind, was the second project, which seems to have evolved over time, but is still hanging onto an accompanying Udacity sandbox that is irrelevant, at best, or misleading, at worst.

The last section of the course covers a few topics about distributed systems: file system; distributed memory; datacenter technologies, which are becoming more popular in the growing cloud computing field. In my opinion, it is a must-take course for students in CS background who need some refreshment for their undergrad OS class. OS knowledge is a core background requirement for almost all CS programs.\nFor the projects: there are 4 projects in total and 3 of them are coding projects. The projects are in C and some familiarity of C is required. I already have C background but the challenge is to complete the projects and pass the Udacity online grading. The online grading can be tricky sometimes because the online grader sometimes does not give you sufficient failure information, besides it is usually more rigorous than your local test run on VM. Many times, you need to insert fprint to just debug. That always takes a lot of time. The piazza forum is always very active and helpful. I would not be surprised if someone has to spend 40-50 hours on one particular coding project. The tip is to start early so you can spread the whole work into 2 or 3 weeks instead of trying to finish it during last weekend. My impression from Piazza is that people who do well in the projects tend to start very early and engage the discussion very early.\nFor the exams, it is closed book closed notes exam. You need to study the videos and read the materials. It is not very difficult, but you do need to spend some time studying them since there are a lot of concepts and details there.\nOverall, it is a very good class.

You just need to do the work. FWIW, I got an A, though it was curved upwards from a low B. I found the exams to be more difficult than the assignments personally, mostly due to the format. Sadly, I didn\'t do as well on them as I would have liked and feel I could have done better on them. My recommendation is to take detailed notes as you watch the lectures and read the papers. Especially take notes as you read the papers. Some of the material is a little dense, and the lectures can be sometimes circuitous. If you\'re watching the lectures through the web, you can set the speed to 1. 25x for the youtube player. You might find this helpful if you\'re having difficulty focusing on the lectures.\nI had professional programming experience but only a little bit in C. I found the programming part difficult only as I was becoming acquainted with the problem. After that, the assignments are very straightforward. Projects 1 and 3 are time consuming and will take 20-30 hours of your time. Projects 2 and 4 will only take 3-5 unless you do the extra credit.\nJudging by my interactions with other students, if you\'re going to take this class and are not comfortable programming, you should:\nLearn how to work inside a VM. Learn how to set up a shared folder between the VM and your host machine in advance if you think you\'ll need it (you probably don\'t)\nLearn enough C. The C programming in this course is not hard, but if you\'re not comfortable with the language\'s semantics you\'ll be overwhelmed on the first assignment.\nLearn how to work in GCC, GDB, Make and Valgrind. There are plenty of great tutorials out there.\nMy only complaint is that the sample exams in Udacity didn\'t adequately prepare me for the real exams. Other than that, this course is excellent.

I highly recommend watching them on at least 1. 25x speed. I started doing this halfway through the semester (eventually bumped up to 1. 5x when re-watching) and realized I could retain a lot more info than having to keep rewinding because my mind was drifting. Only a handful of papers to read, most were pretty dated but helped drive some concepts home. If you are looking for an easy class though, this is not for you.

Chapters are short and easy to read/comprehend. Highly recommend it!\nFull Details: The projects are, as mentioned everywhere else, difficult and clarification of parts are necessary. I would recommend being comfortable with at least the basics of C (pointers, func pointers, extern usage, getopts, string parsing, file manipulation, etc. ). For some that might be too basic but if you know how to read through the provided code then you should be okay to at least get through the simpler portions of the projects.

About 35-40% of the students will drop, and this has been consistent throughout the terms so far. General programming experience almost doesn\'t even matter, but having the right experience does. People with 10 years of programming experience struggled. For reference, I had maybe worked a job using a higher level language than C for about a few months before taking this course, and most of my academic and job experience was fairly nontechnical in nature. I did not even graduate in STEM.\nOf course, understanding C is necessary to do well, but I can promise you that not knowing C is NOT the primary limitation that most people will suggest. Being able to take a spec, design a solution, test it thoroughly, and refactor to apply the right patterns are far more indicative of whether or not you will succeed in this course. I didn\'t find the programming assignments particularly difficult, but a lot of people struggled against the autograder so a bit of gusto for debugging would certainly help you as well. You should still start the projects early so that you can let the ideas marinate in your head as you\'re going about your daily routine. The tests were nothing to write home about; just your standard review of the details will do. What helped me most was taking screenshots of key video stills into OneNote and maybe writing a few supplemental notes to jot down specifics as I listened along at 2x speed. That workflow was sufficient enough for me to grasp the material.\nGoing by the reviews, this, Machine Learning, and Algorithms are by far the most time-consuming classes. I heard somewhere that AOS was easier, but the statistics seem to reflect an equivalent success rate (~40% drop). All of these classes will expect different things out of you, and this course in particular should challenge your programming abilities relative to other courses. Operating Systems classes are notorious for having the most legitimate programming assignments, whereas Algorithms on the other end of the spectrum expect you to have a higher level of mathematical maturity and the ability to write proofs, which fewer people possess. I CAN give advice on the latter, but this is not the review for that :)\nInstructor and TA support was pretty top notch from what I saw, although this won\'t be the case for every single course in the program.

Even so, you should probably expect to spend 20 to 30 hours on two of the four projects. Don\'t bother with the extra credit options on the projects unless you really want to. They will add quite a bit of additional time while only affecting your grade by about 1% each.\nLectures/Tests The lectures are a little slow paced.

Regarding the projects I think there were a few misconceptions - firstly I don\'t think that C is a massive hurdle here that it is percevied to be. I think the real challenge is coming up with a suitable design to fulfill project objectives. I acknowledge that the autograder can be frustrating at times but it did make me think critically about what I was intending my code to do and what it was actually doing. When I reconciled my design and objectives the autograder would be happy. Secondly, I spent too much time on design and underestimated the amount of testing that was required. The projects are a little thin on specification so it is more or less up to you to devise suitable test cases that match what you think the project objectives are.

The code skeletons and Udacity autograder are new this semester, as I understand it. I personally enjoyed the projects the most from this class, and while the autograder can be frustrating at times (when the feedback is too vague, or you don\'t really get any at all), I was always able to find the issue by doing more testing of corner cases myself, which would uncover a crash or deadlock in certain circumstances. The benefit is that you once you\'ve passed the autograder you can be confident that you\'ve done things correctly. I also like the new phased approach to the first project, where you have a few \'build-up\' assignments that you should complete before the main project. I personally didn\'t find the code skeletons a problem or too restrictive, although understanding how it all fits together can be overwhelming at first. By looking at what is given in the skeleton and how certain functions are defined you should be able to figure out how to make everything fit together.

There are also many opportuniteis for extra credit. There are very easy ways to prepare for this course, download an ubuntu linux VM and start writing C that reads and writes from files, sends text and data overa TCP/IP socket, performs string manipulation, and parses command line arguments. These skills were necessary to complete the projects, but not the focus of the project. Despite how much work these projects require, you have plenty of time to start on them (you can start project one on day 1 and it is due 6 weeks in). NOTE: I spent on average 10-15 hours per week, but this is because I worked ahead on light weeks. If you strictly follow the syllabus you will not succeed. For example the first two weeks of the course only took about 2 hours a piece to complete, but I used that time to start project 1 early and it paid off. Start early, use the forums on Piazza, get used to linux and C, and fight the urge to be a perfectionist. It is easy to self induce work on these projects and overwhelm yourself.

The relationship has felt surprisingly personal. Hopefully that persists beyond their first semester.\nThe projects can be very time consuming. I echo that you need to know C. Some specific C skills you\'ll need and are expected to have for Project 1 are the following:\nstring manipulation (i. e. , strcpy, strcat, strtok) and understanding/using null-terminated strings\nuse of pointers; nothing too complex like pointer arithmetic, but knowing how to initialize them, malloc space for them, derefence a pointer, and use the address of a variable as a pointer reference\ngeneral memory functions like malloc, free, memset -- this might be challenging if you\'ve only used more abstract languages like Java and C#; took a while for me to wrap my head around it\nfile I/O: binary read/write, reading a file size (lseek)\nusing proper header files for prototyping (. h files) and (in later projects) incorporating provided. h files to implement APIs\ncreating a basic Makefile to build your application (though after Project 1 they started providing these)\ncreating a queue (linked list) structure and the functions needed to queue and dequeue items in an instance of that structure (again, after Project 1 they provided a library for this; not sure if future iterations of the class would go ahead and throw that in as a resource for the first project)\nYou\'re expected to be able to do the above with only the most basic and standard C libraries. We were allowed to ask if we could use a certain library to complete parts of our projects, but to my knowledge none of the small handful of requests were approved. But once C starts clicking and you get a handle on the basics, you don\'t really need any special libraries.\nThere\'s also a brief overview early on of how to create a basic web server and web client that communicate over a socket, which you\'ll have to implement and expand on (every project is a client/server combination). I found it to be a little too basic, but I was also struggling to get my C legs (get it?). I\'d recommend that if you\'re a C noob, you also find a good introduction to connecting to, sending, and receiving over a socket. The first project requires that as part of its functionality, but while there\'s a lot more to it than that, I found it to be one of the most time-consuming portions.\nIf that seems overwhelming, I can say that I started the course with no previous C experience. I had primarily done C# and Java coding prior to taking this class, and I was able to get up to speed. If you have decent coding experience, you\'ll be fine. You\'ll just learn how much you take for granted. :)\nAs far as the material/exams go, I found that to be very easy to handle.

I had very little experience coding in C++, and I had never coded in C before. The first two projects were in C, while the last two projects were in C++. I put it in a lot of hours into this class, trying to learn C/C++ as well as trying to succeed on the projects. Because of the extra effort, I did really well on the projects.\nMy favorite projects were Project 2 (C) and Project 4 (C++). For Project 2, we had to use the libvirt API to create a CPU scheduler and memory coordinator to manage virtual machines with varying resource usage. For Project 4, we had to create an implementation of the MapReduce using gRPC - this was the biggest project in the class and was also the final one. They gave us 4 weeks instead of 2 weeks to finish it, and I think I spent 3 weeks total on the project.\nI found the exams to be difficult because you basically had to memorize a lot of information. This class covered several different operating systems and algorithms that were developed decades ago. Old midterms and finals were already on T-Square, so if you had to time to go through all of the old tests and skim through the research papers, then you would do fine on the tests. I definitely preferred the projects over the exams though.\nThe class is curved at the end though, so as long as you start on the projects early and score really high on them, and not completely bomb the tests, you can get an A in the class.','Very Hard','Loved!','20 hours/week'),('CS-6210: Advanced Operating Systems','MMi8lvpTffNDzWsx56j3tHZp2p32','This was my first course in the OMS CS program.

It was interesting to learn of many concepts that were \"ahead of their time\" and just now coming into mainstream given cloud and data center technologies.\nThe projects were slightly harder than average difficulty and required good knowledge of C++ (in particular C++ 11). Coming from a C++/embedded background this was not too difficult, but given some of the Piazza posts many had problems in this area. Most projects had \"multi-threaded\" attributes, so a good understanding of threads is a good thing to know coming into the class. Nonetheless, all the projects had a high \"learning value\", introducing us to several technologies I haven\'t been exposed to (but expect to put into practice).\nThe assigned readings were also voluminous, with many of them supporting the lectures. Plan to spend countless hours reading these papers. Several details of the papers were asked on the midterm and/or final exams, so this is not an optional component of the class. Most of the papers were actually quite informative, though some went into a lot of details and performance evaluations, which could\'ve been summarized in just a few sentences (I mostly just skimmed these sections and got the necessary information our of the summary).\nBy far, the most challenging aspect of the course were the midterm and final exams, which together comprised 42% of the overall grade. These tests were quite simply \"hard\". The tests did not exactly focus on the facts learned during the course, but instead on whether the student understood the concepts/facts and could make additional deductions on those facts. The exams, while still performed in Verificent/Proctortrack were all essay type questions. Even the True/False questions required an explanation in order to get credit. The exams were definitely comprehensive over the material.\nThe lectures were actually quite good. The professor took the time to convey key concepts, including examples and details. Of course, his lectures were primarily an overview with examples of the assigned readings. The TAs were quite helpful and responsive on Piazza.\nPerhaps the only negative (I consider the \"difficulty of the course a positive) was that the projects took a long time to be graded. At midterm (i.e., time to withdraw), only about 30% of the grades had been posted. This may have been caused by significant events during the early part of the semester (Hurricane Irma, Harvey and Katia) that impacted a lot of students (and in the case of Irma the Atlanta campus). A special 1 time \"late forgiveness\" policy was however, introduced to accommodate those impacted by these storms. I was a little disappointed in that the course did not go into more \"kernel level\" OS details, but stayed a little higher level detailing how OS support newer technologies such as security, data centers and distributed computing systems, which seems to be more of the trend.\nI would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in distributed systems. Don\'t be misled into believing that the course is just an advanced undergraduate OS type course.

They can be time consuming, especially the latter projects. Especially if you\'re not familiar or comfortable working in C and a Linux (or unix-like) environment.

Read over every paper at least once to help gain insight into the topics discussed in the lecture videos. And read the papers before the lecture videos.\nFinal course grade is curved.

The amount of time you spend on projects will directly correlate with your knowledge and comfort level in C/C++. Other than the first project your algorithms/design approach will essentially be handed to you, and the point is to either implement the logic or learn a framework.\nWhile you can skate by not reading the papers, this will end up hurting you in the end. Some of the complexities of the material is glossed over in the lectures only to be exposed in the readings. Though if you correlate the \"hot topics\" of previous midterms/finals with the papers, you\'ll get a good idea of what papers are more important than others.\nOverall this is a difficult class but certainly doable.

Professor clearly knows the material.\nExams: Midterm and final were humbling, vast amount of data, require precise details, previous midterms/finals available, most questions recur, focus on those topics.\nPapers: read (nearly) 40 papers (required and optional), plus other relevant papers; learn to efficiently read and understand academic papers and glean important content, reread important papers.\nProjects: require Linux (ubuntu VM), and good C programming skill; userthreads - learn about user space threads, scheduling, context swaps, signals, locking; barriers - learn about MPI, OpenMP distributed computing, barrier synchronization, write performance summary; web caching - learn about RPC, caching (LRU, LFU, LRUMIN), measure performance, test case bias; reliable virtual memory - learn about transactions and log structured files.\nProjects take 30-60 hours each. Papers average 2. 5/week (2-4 hours each). Study for midterm and final (20-40 hours each). You will learn enough about systems work to decide whether the area interests you. I reread many papers, and watched most lectures 2-3 times.\nProject specifications were ambiguous, students shared tests, share the test case writing workload, typical online challenges (questions, feedback), test proctoring had problems.

The lessons are long and complicated, and each one comes with a bunch of scientific papers that you need to read and understand. I found the material fascinating but reading and learning the content of the papers will probably take some getting used to.\nThere are two exams in this class. Both are closed notes and for each one you have to understand a ton of content. The questions are not limited to single or multiple-choice which make the exams even more complicated. My class did very poorly on both exams, and we had to wait for a generous curve to pull our grades up.\nI scored 57 out of 100 on the first exam and an incredible 75 in the second. These, together with solid grades on all the projects, gave me all I needed to finish with an A. Participation in the class was also a big factor, so I recommend you make yourself visible as much as you can.\nBy the way, be ready to code a lot. The projects were amazingly interesting and complicated, and we had to code like crazy to finish them. Any previous knowledge of C will certainly help you out here, but I although my C was very rusty, I was able to pull through after some long nights.\nNot everyone was lucky on these projects, and a big portion of the class wasn\'t able to even find the solution to some of them. I\'d recommend starting as soon as you get access to the project description because you\'ll need every minute you can get.\nOn this course you don\'t work on teams, so your success or failure is entirely on you.

They were tough at times, but I felt it was time well spent.

First, I was interested in learning more about computer networks. Next, from reviews on OMSCentral, this seemed to be on average one of the easier courses, so it provided a good stepping stone into the program. I have an aerospace degree and have worked in the world of defense software for about 4 years now.\nPros:\nThe head TA (Stacia Stokes) is very attentive and present on Piazza. Two thumbs up here.\nEach project has enough time to complete.\nThe lectures, articles/readings, and projects do tie together for the most part.\nYou do learn a lot about both the historical and modern concepts of network programming. They don\'t go too deep, but that\'s mainly because there is a lot of ground to cover.\nTwo instances of extra credit were offered (one for weekly discussions, another for an extra portion of the last project)\nCons:\nThe articles were difficult to read through. Interesting topics, but the important points were buried in the article (typical techincal paper...).\nThe lecture videos can be a bit jumpy in its explanations, though it still holds to the overall lecture topic.\nI had hoped to do a little more with software-defined networks (SDN\'s)\nProjects 2 and 3 were intense (but if you get past those, you\'ll be fine.)\nTest questions could sometimes be vague, and thus difficult to answer.\nProctorTrack may be more of a pain than it\'s worth.\nOverall I\'m happy with this course. I recommend it as a first course for anyone starting the program without a network background. This course uses Python, so you\'d benefit from already knowing it, but that\'s not a necessity. Time spent each week really varied and depended on the project. I probably spent time more than I needed to, so take that into account for the \"weekly workload\" stat.','Medium','Loved!','15 hours/week'),('CS-6250: Computer Networks','4oD0WVLeRgRl6f4XGAD99vfr90J2','If you want to get A with little to medium effort, this class is good.

I took this class first because I don\'t have a lot of computer science courses under my belt, this is a foundational course I think any good software developer should take, the reviews indicated this is a relatively low workload course (compared to, e.g., Machine Learning and the like), and I am good with Python (and this class uses Python).\nFirst, the good points. I feel like I learned a lot about principles of system design and why the Internet is designed the way it is. The projects were a good mix of \"implement this algorithm\", \"configure a virtual network\", and \"reproduce and analyze the results from this academic paper\". The last item, reproducing and analyzing an academic paper, was particularly nice because it exposed me to how computer science research is actually done, experience that I did not have. That said, reading the papers and writing the report did eat up a lot of time, especially compared to the actual programming portions of the projects (I am an experienced Python programmer, so this part was a breeze). None of the projects were group projects, so that is also a huge plus. The lectures were mostly engaging, with enthusiastic presenters.\nNow, some negatives. The tests were usually not well designed. There were three, and only the first seemed to do a good job asking interesting questions that required advanced thinking about the concepts; the other two were filled mostly with what seemed like arbitrary tidbits from the readings and lectures, and were sometimes ambiguously worded. Also, some of the projects\' instructions were not clear and the TAs sometimes did a poor job with clarifications, resulting in more anxiety and confusion about the projects than should have been there. Lastly, the professor made approximately two appearances all semester, one of those being during finals week to assign three entire papers to read and respond to for extra credit, taking the place of \"weekly discussions\" we were promised throughout the semester. This was poor form, and someone complained that this violated GA Tech policy of not assigning other work during finals week, so we all got extra credit without the need to participate in discussion or read the papers. Fine, but why not just do the discussions as indicated on the syllabus?\nOverall, I was happy with the course. It was a good first course for OMSCS, and I feel like the positives outweigh the negatives, so I would take it again. And, although I perhaps put in more hours than others with a more relevant background, I found the time commitment very manageable, given I have a full-time, minimal other commitments, and was taking only this class.

The tests were all single-answer / multiple-choice, and relatively straightforward, if you had boned up on the material.

However, she was a very positive, clarifying presence whenever she did weigh in.\nThere were a number of TA\'s who were friendly and helpful, but from whom we heard little. A lot of that appeared to be due to the fact that the lead TA (Stacia Stokes) seemed not to be a big fan of delegation.

The class was essentially ran by the Head TA, who did a fine job, but it was disappointing to miss that expert-level interaction.

It can be tough to know what the \"best\" answer is.

This is hardly accurate. The course clearly lists at least an introductory level in Python is required. The first two projects are probably the hardest of the semester, but both can be completed with around 50 lines of code. The real challenge is in understanding the algorithm. The code itself requires nothing more than the ability to use variables, follow control logic, and pass messages, all capabilities learned in any introductory computer science course. The undergraduate networking course required implementations in C, and those projects were much more time-consuming then anything found here.\nOverall, I recommend the course to anyone interested in Computer Networks as an operational discipline.

I selected it because it looked like one of the easier courses in the OMSCS program, and I wanted to start off with an easy course my first semester back in college.\nMy assessment was correct. This is the easiest course I\'ve taken so far by a considerable margin. A little too easy.\nThe best part of this course was the interesting papers that we were assigned to read each week.\nLectures were okay. They covered a lot of ground, which was nice but often did so in a superficial manner. Exams also covered a lot of ground, but superficially.\nFor the most part, the assignments were poorly put together and most of the \"challenge\" in them was working around the parts that were broken or poorly specified. There was one exception. Project 2 was actually pretty interesting, and a reasonable challenge. I got my hopes up after it, thinking that it was representative of what was to come, but sadly, the assignment quality went down from there.\nThe professor left the TAs to fend for themselves for the most part. I think she posted in Piazza a handful of times the entire semester.

Do a few \"projects\", some of which require programming watered-down versions of standard algorithms, and some of which are just step-by-step tutorials on how to configure some network service (and write a report -- \"What did you see when you typed run. sh?\"). The ONE open-ended part of the class was to be weekly discussions on Piazza with the prof. These never happened. More on that below.\nIt was very poorly run. The prof (MK) never showed up after the first week. Not once. This might be OK in another class, but it meant that we didn\'t get any of the open-ended, research-oriented interaction promised in the syllabus. It also meant that the TAs floundered. They kept saying, \"I emailed the prof and I\'ll let you know what I hear. \" On the rare occasion the TAs were able to reach the prof, she made more false promises about when she\'d show up. Prof hung the TAs out to dry, along with the entire class. The TAs made effort for the first half of the course, but by the end, most Piazza questions about the material went unanswered -- even the ones asking for guidance on errors in the test prep materials.\nThe exams were multiple choice and T/F with lots of ambiguity. In higher education, there\'s often some ambiguity, and you write about it and address it. In a multiple-choice exam, however, there is no opportunity to address the ambiguity! The tests are written using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, and I never knew whether I was overthinking a sloppily-written question or if it was a trick question. Both types (sloppy and trick) are on the exam. I managed to do pretty well, but that was by careful deconstruction of the test author\'s psyche. Or guessing.\nRead the papers, watch the videos, and follow the tutorial projects like a monkey.

We were waiting for announcements that never came. The TA\'s favorite saying was, \"I\'m still waiting to hear back from the professor\".\nThe test grading was absolutely ridiculous - the final was 30% of your grade and it was filled with multiple choice questions where the possible credit per question was 0, 0, 20, 60, or 100%. (5 multiple choice options, and any incorrect selections subtracted from your credit. This was true whether it was supposed to un/checked although the claimed purpose was to \"prevent people from clicking every option\" so not checking a box that was supposed to be checked still gets you marked off, which was stupid). So if you got 4/5 choices correct, you got 60% credit. 3/5 got you 20% credit. So stupid.\nThere are a TON of papers to read that have no relationship to the course except that the exams ask questions specific questions about them.\nI feel like too many people before said, \"This class is easy!\" so the professors/TAs decided to make things stupidly hard. I got an A on the final because I studied my ass off. I don\'t understand the need for rote memorization on things that don\'t matter, especially not for a meaningless exam that is 30%! of your grade, ESPECIALLY when there were questions that had absolutely nothing to the work we did in the course.\nI was very excited to take this course as it relates to personal interests, but this class was a huge disappointment.

If you got the projects done during the first week, the second week was mostly just lectures/reading.\nThere is a ton of reading in this class. It can get a bit dry and daunting, especially since each week there are a handful of papers to read, each being ~13-15 pages in length. On top of that, some projects have a surprise paper that must be read to complete it. On top of this, even though some papers are split into the second week of the project, they are helpful to read if completing the project during the first week. This also applies to the video lectures.\nFor the summer semester, there were 5 projects and 2 tests. Project 1-3 were pretty simple, Project 2 taking the most time. Projects 4-5 were a bit more open ended and validating your work could sometimes be difficult.\nBecause it was the summer, they squished the latter half of the content into a single exam worth 30% of your grade. In my opinion, this was too heavily weighted, with each incorrect answer reducing your final grade by over 1% (as there were only 26 questions on this exam. )\nThe TAs were responsive and helpful, but the instructor was completely absent. She appeared once to ask \"why we were interested in the course. \" She was supposed to post weekly discussion threads to provoke thoughtful discussion, but this never happened.

More time will be required if you are rusty on your networking skills, as you\'ll need to read the textbook to catch up on basic concepts. On top of that there is a project every other week, which usually doesn\'t require much programming, and took me 3-5 hours on average. There are also 3 closed book tests which take a few hours to study for - easier if you have taken good notes.\nThis is a very good course to take. It should be called \"Advanced Computer Networking\", because like AOS, it covers modern research topics in computer networking. It is generally assumed you have a working knowledge of computer networks, and there will be little hand holding here. I learned a lot, even having professional experience. I highly recommend this course as a very practical course to take that will benefit any software engineer in their career.\nThe professor, M. Konte, is a internet security researcher, and the weekly office hours are a chance to pick her brain on stuff. She wasn\'t involved as much as I\'d have liked on Piazza, though. The TAs though were very responsive on Piazza and slack - expect very quick turnarounds (< 12h) on questions asked. Tests and projects were generally graded within a couple weeks. So it\'s a very well run course overall.\nThe only negative is that a few of the projects had issues. This wasted me a lot of time on one project in particular, which was pretty annoying.

I often had to repeat each \"lesson\" 2-3 times to really capture and/or understand some of the concepts.\nThe tests (only 3 of them) were a little more difficult than I thought, but were fair and covered the material well. A lot of the test covered the outside readings and/or projects... definitely testing your understanding of the subject matter instead of just the facts of it.\nThere were a lot of projects (8+) in this course, and usually before you finished one, the next one was already out and time ticking on it. One or two of the projects were problematic (computer/VM wise) and were stressful to accomplish. I didn\'t mind putting in time to learn the material, but fighting with the tools was not productive time spent. I had a few commitments at work during this time which made it even more stressful. However, each of the projects were insightful and worthwhile, though a couple that evaluated certain protocol performance were not as exciting, but learned a great deal anyway.\nThe TAs (and Maria) were pretty responsive on Piazza, and held weekly office hours.\nFor me (after 25yrs) since BS degree, it was interesting to see how networking has changed and what was good then is being re-evaluated.

The tests felt a little bit luck-based -- did you happen to remember one sentence from one of the dozen research papers you read? If yes, it was easy. If not, then impossible to guess. I don\'t think the tests did a good job judging whether you\'d learned the big picture or even the majority of individual topics discussed, rather they seemed mostly a sample of minutiae from the papers which you may or may not remember.\nOne big warning, I think they\'ve revamped this course in the last semester or two, because it was fairly challenging (especially the tests) and took a decent amount of time each week. There\'s some kind of project or test almost every single week, so you really don\'t get much of a break.\nPast reviews indicated this class was easy. I don\'t think that\'s true anymore.

But I could feel that the class was kind of in an awkward state right now, perhaps transitioning somewhat from a heaver focus on SDN when the course was first designed. Lectures referred to projects that were no longer part of the course, for example, and I\'d say only the last two of the eight projects really involved playing around with SDN.\nThe remainder of the projects concerned fundamentals (e. g. graph search over a topology) or were follow-along demonstrations of topics we read about in journal articles. These latter projects really required no coding -- you\'d just follow the instructions provided and write up the results.\nSome of the projects were newly designed and had bugs, but those were worked out and time extensions were given where necessary. If they keep the same project structure I don\'t expect that to be a problem in later semesters.\nA couple other reviews say the tests were hard. I didn\'t think so, really?

There was something due nearly every week, with projects of varying difficulty and with tests definitely requiring a good amount of time to study, as they included a lot of \"short essay\" questions, were timed, and proctored (via ProctorTrack).\nI found this class very enjoyable because it didn\'t include a lot of \"busy work\" - most everything we were asked to do led to learning something valuable. The projects were the best part. The tests were fair in that if you read all the material and did all the projects, you were pretty well prepared, but if you didn\'t understand something, it would become apparent on the short essay questions, of which there were many.\nI\'d say the class is \"easy\" in that it does not require too much prior CS knowledge to succeed. You need to know a little bit of Python for most projects (but way less than KBAI or Computer Photography, for example), and you need to stay on top of things because there is a lot of material.

They varied in difficulty, but a couple of them were very long. However, the tests and the projects didn\'t seem to test our knowledge of them very extensively (other than what was in the homeworks).\nLectures: These are good, but they are not very consistent in the amount of detail covered.

If at all possible, avoid taking it until the instructors have raised the quality bar.\nComputer Networks is an interesting and important field of study within Computer Science. This is knowledge that you should gain. Unfortunately, the structure and presentation of this class is incredibly frustrating and ambiguous. You still really struggle to get an A in this class because the class is poorly designed. The content isn\'t inherently challenging. The class is just designed to make it hard to do well.\nLectures: the lectures are quite poor and disorganized. There is no clear thread tying them together and complex concepts pop up and vanish again for the remainder of the course within a single breath... until they show up later on a quiz (more below). The lecture content has tremendous breadth but is frequently covered at such a shallow and unclear level that it is practically useless. If you want to spend hours reading Wikipedia articles, trying to understand what the professor is trying to teach, take this course.\nTests/quizzes: oh boy... most quizzes are \"select all of the correct responses\" style. Which means that 6-question quizzes essentially entail digging for minutia in order to discount even a single potential response. Prepare yourself for hours of Google + Wikipedia + watching random YouTube videos in the hope of uncovering a kernel that may/may not help you answer the question. Frequently, the wording on quizzes was so ambiguous that Piazza was flooded with questions and office hours were spent asking the instructor to clarify the same question over and over again. What seems like an easy \"1 quick quiz per week or two\" turns into a 3-4 day treasure hunt with the hope that an instructor might properly explain the intent of a question/answer option.\nProjects: the only good part of this course. The projects were occasionally a bit trivial but gave some programming practice in Python and helped to give a few concepts the depth of understanding that they deserve. Even the projects though were fraught: the instructors had to make the last project optional since so many people weren\'t able to understand it/make it run on their virtual machines.\nI\'ll repeat it again: this class is not inherently challenging. From previous semesters, it looks like this class was \"take this if you want an A\" easy. Instead of making projects more challenging or treating the content at any additional depth, the instructors simply made it more difficult to get an A. This course is difficult because of ambiguity, a lack of depth and poor assessments.\nIn case you were wondering, these concerns were raised to the instructors multiple times on Piazza throughout the semester. Each time, they were met with a shrug or a reason why the students\' concerns were invalid. For me, this exemplifies a lack of awareness and understanding among the instructors for students who are just trying hard to learn.\nKeep in mind that I\'m currently scoring in the 85%+ range.

Cons: Test questions lead to ambiguity and make it harder. Even when valid arguments were given for bad questions no credit was normally given.

The instructors are trying to make it artificially hard because the reviews from previous semesters were saying that the course is easy. The result is vaguely worded tests, disappointing grades that are curved down, and core material that is still easy.\nThe lectures are good because they cover an interesting range of topics (a broader range than other networking classes I\'ve seen). But they lack a bit in depth and need to be augmented. The current instructors are not the developers of the course and in some instances have a different approach. However they claim that they cannot change a single video segment or annotate it because \"it is easier to redevelop the entire course than it is to change one bit of it. \" I find this claim ridiculous at best.\nThe projects are very interesting but a bit easy. Those can definitely be made more challenging.\nThe quizes are a mess. They\'re vaguely worded and depend on the instructor\'s interpretation. They tend to be open ended, but you\'re expected to answer with a multiple choice or be constrained to 200 words. And in most cases, you\'re penalized because either you missed a nuance that\'s only clear in the instructor\'s mind, or because you didn\'t elaborate (although you\'re constrained to 200 words). My grades were like a crap shoot, totally random per quiz, for an equal amount of preparation for each quiz and understanding of the material.\nThe office hours were like a morning radio show with banter and little substance. I can tell that the instructors were trying hard to curve down the grades. Initially they claimed that an A will only be 92 and above (they reduced it later to a 90). They finally settled on the vaguely worded tests to make the course appear to be hard even though that\'s the wrong way to do it.','Hard','','5 hours/week'),('CS-6250: Computer Networks','48063c72-e724-49f5-8a16-e2132bd9217b','It\'s not a good sign when a TA calls a test question \"ridiculously counter-intuitive\", and comments that he too would have chosen the incorrect answer.\nIf you are intent on thoroughly learning the material presented in this course, beware: Your grade (especially your test grades) may not reflect your knowledge. A large portion of your time will be spent trying to figure out semantics of obscure test questions, troubleshooting faulty project templates, and arguing with instructors.\nIt is true the content of this course does not demand a large number of hours per week to read or watch. However, the open-book format of the tests is IN NO WAY an advantage. The “select all that apply” multiple-choice scheme was deemed unfair by MANY students, mostly because of the way T-Square deducts points for incorrectly selected options. Watching the lecture videos, reading the papers, and even participating in office hours do NOT lay the path for scoring well on the tests.\nThe projects can be a good source of learning the material, despite the fact they are 80% reading instructions and looking over the supplied templates and 20% actually writing code.\nIn the Fall 2015 session, the instructors were mostly attentive to students’ concerns (via Piazza and office hours), even if some answers included “that’s just the way it is, it cannot be changed. ” (This was a common response referring to tests in T-Square). I think the instructors were probably doing the best they could with the atrocious class they were given. However, I doubt any of them would have tolerated the mishaps we students had to deal with.\nCONCLUSION: This class needs to be scrapped and totally redone.

I tried to ensure my questions were concise, clear (sighting examples where possible), and demonstrated that I understood the related material throughly. In my experience, Prof Lillethun and the TAs were forthright and always willing to clarify things.\nUse office hours effectively! Office hours are your opportunity to speak to the Prof about the material and get answers and direction on homework, quizzes, and projects. The Instructors were willing to put a lot of time into the office hours, so take advantage of it.\nIn advance of the quiz, they provide homework questions and answers. The homework answers are very useful on the quizzes. Use them.\nT-square sucks. When you answer a question that accepts multiple answers, do not guess at an answer. Incorrect choices will be deducted from any correct choices. So be conservative. Don\'t gamble on choices that you aren\'t sure of.\nT-square sucks. Make sure you record your answers and back them up on your computer.\nThe projects aren\'t very hard, but you do need to have some basic programming. experience. If this isn\'t you, you might as well use this course to begin developing that experience (because Python is a good first language to learn, and you will certainly need it on other courses in the program).

The TAs are spending a lot of time regrading and fixing these grading errors, but it\'s a huge distraction from the actual coursework. The quiz questions themselves are the weakest and newest part of the course, many of the questions are incorrect and are changed before the deadline, worded ambiguously due to grammar or other issues, cover material outside of the course itself, or use terminology and techniques simlar to but different from the course material.

I was very motivated and wanted to excel. I watched every single weekly video and read all suggested materials. I took many notes and was very serious. However, this course is a complete pleasantry. Let me explain.\n1) The weekly videos are someone reading the slide without giving any content. The slides are extracted from whitepapers and mostly just the first paragraph of each subject. The videos do not explain; they give outlines of many topics.\n2) Each week has too many covered subjects. It\'s tough to understand everything with the lack of material. Whitepapers are not clear, long to read and a lot of additional web research is required. Videos took me about 1h on average to consume and white papers about 10h. The remaining time was invested in projects.\n3) Projects are not related to the lectures. In fact, the projects cover one topic of about 30 discussed in the three weeks the project cover.\n4) TAs only answer project answers. Several questions about whitepapers were never answered.\n5) Projects are not well constructed. Lots of information are given during the timeframe of the assignment making people working late on the project with a considerable advantage. Some projects requirements were written over +70 PowerPoint slides.\n6) Quiz answers are all available on Internet.\n7) Final tests are made to trick you. Many questions were related to a subject seen, but the question was touching an area not covered by the lecture. You had to know about the subject deeply to answer. The final exam had many errors (English and structural).\n8) Projects worth the most in this course. 5 of them took between 20 to 45 hours to complete. Spread over 2-3 weeks per project it becomes a burden with the whitepapers and videos. The two combined explain why I have an average of about 22 hours per week.\n9) Prof Lee is entirely absent from this course. The TAs are doing their best, but they are swamped by assignments questions which prove the lack of cleanliness as well as the disconnect between the material and the projects.\n10) They mention buying a book (200 pages). After reading half of it, I realized that it was a waste of time and money. There was a single page that was barely usable for a single project. A student asked about the book and no TA, neither the professor answered about how important was the book was for the class.\nIt was my first course, and if GaTech is running this way, I\'ll stop. The quality is deficient of this course, and it is evident that there was no real intention to teach anything else than cramping a lot of subjects in little time to make it hard.

You will apply your computer science skills on this course, so like others mentioned here lecture videos are shallow, skimmed through and covered lot of topics. If you are research oriented, curious to dig through then this course is for you. Its overwhelming to do 10 quizzes, 1 final and 5 projects.

Initially i had to juggle 3 courses, so i ended up blowing up on 1 assignment which had a big impact on my grades. TAs were very comfortable on regrade requests and did their best. It appears that materials have changed from past semesters, so if you are new to computer security and expect to learn from course videos and apply it to projects, you are not going to like this course.

I would rate this course a Very Hard in terms of understanding what is actually expected of you, but Easy in terms of actual content.\nHonestly, the assignments were not challenging as long as you read every single Piazza post, even if there were dozens. Because I did not do that and just did the assignments as outlined on the assignment description (generally taking around 10 hours for each assignment), without fail, I would receive anywhere from 50-70% on every assignment, and then be forced to request a regrade and claw back points. Every regrade gave me 20+ points, so they are definitely worth it, but it is an absolutely ridiculous process if you think about the effort TAs have to put in to basically grade everything twice because they were not explicit in the assignment instructions the first time or their autograder was just wrong.\nYou would think since this class is so poorly managed, that you would be allowed to ask clarifying questions on Piazza, but after one TA repeatedly responded in a downright rude manner to anyone\'s innocent questions, I decided to forgo that strategy and just rely on the obnoxious regrading requests to get an accurate grade.\nAlso don\'t expect the final to be any less vague or subjective than the quizzes you do all semester.

There are far better courses available in OMSCS. Warning: The instructor was not engaged in the course. This course is taught by TAs and centered on projects run by TAs. Expect rude responses on piazza.\nRead the reviews! I regret not paying heed to the [negative] course reviews. As a veteran of several OMSCS courses, this was the worst. Despite the problems, I learned a lot about Network Security [lectures and readings], and couple of projects were enjoyable and worth the effort.\nNetwork Security has a reputation as being a less challenging course, but difficulty may be normalized. One way to increase difficulty would be to cover material in greater depth or expand covered material. The approach chosen by this course seemed to add work and make project descriptions indecipherable. Many OMSCS students have extensive IT experience, often in the practical tools used in this course. You need to learn Wireshark, Snort, web development, javascript, etc, to be successful.\nThe course lectures are an overview of the material; lecture notes are provided. Listen to the lectures and review the notes, as they introduce concepts. Most of the course content lies in the readings and the projects.\nThere were tons of readings between the papers (over 60), and books (penetration testing, bitcoin, etc). Many of these readings were excellent, and clearly conveyed extensive information about security, although a few papers were undecipherable. One can try to discern which readings are important, and which less relevant. Since many readings are not relevant to the projects, quizzes or final, a less motivated student could skip 80% of the papers, avoid much of the knowledge presented in the course, and still earn an A or B.\nThere were five projects (80% of course grade). The projects were disconnected. Each approached a different aspect of network security. Project descriptions varied in quality, and ranged from clear and understandable (great) to undecipherable (terrible). The general impression is that the projects were a tragic mess.\nThe hardest part of the course was the struggle to puzzle out what was needed to succeed on the projects. The TAs shared crucial information in office hours and on slack. Follow these channels as well as piazza, as a summary of slack/office hours are not provided on piazza.\nOne project was composed of two sub-projects. One part used regular expressions (literature consensus repudiates approach) and expected students to guess what patterns to detect. Another used javascript and iframe(s), and many students were unable to guess the trick. Many students did not guess how to perform parts, and the average was ~50%. Do not expect TAs to provide guidance, even after the project is completed.\nAnother project required students to detect malicious behavior in packet captures, learn snort, and construct rules to detect the patterns. The project seemed more about finding needles in haystacks (malicious packets in captures), than learning how to effectively use snort as an IDS. Half of the points were a summary report from detected packet patterns. The all-or-nothing grading was harsh. Expect to request regrades.\nAnother project writeup specified one-one or one-many to perform blending attacks, but TAs announced that only one approach would gain full marks. Alternative solutions and critical thinking were not rewarded. The TAs announced rubric changes mid-project (read all piazza posts). Students were graded by different criteria depending upon when project submitted.\nSince TAs effectively taught the course, one relied upon TAs to provide a good experience. The tone of the TAs on piazza was generally rude and defiant (bordered on abusive), and the course was an unpleasant experience.\nThere were ten quizzes, open book & notes, extremely easy, but with specific open & close dates. Grading criteria changed mid-course from multiple attempts to single attempt. The quizzes were busy work and an exercise in time-management.\nThe final was cumulative, the questions were poorly phrased and tricky, and seemed more like trivia than exam.

Fortunately, when issues arise the TAs have been pretty flexible and understanding for the most part.

It provides a nice way to experience being a white hacker to test your defenses and learn how to improve them.\nThe course was not well thought out, and assignment issues caused students to have their access revoked due to not following GT IT policies. The majority of the assignments were hard to understand and much clarification was needed due to not being fully vetted. Many times the instructors told students to start early, and then those who did were penalized because they had to redo assignments based on the erratas that were released later, often a week into or days before the due date. Be prepared to monitor ALL Piazza and slack communications daily, even after you submit assignments in case the requirements change for what needs to be submitted.\nOverall, the course had great potential and learning opportunities, but was dulled by the inconsistencies, errors, and lack of communication from the instructors.\nThe Professor must have been too involved in his research to even care about his students or class.

Some had intended answers not yet covered. Others had you ordering exploits by how common they are or ordering some other set of things with some other metric, also without prior coverage. To summarize, many of the lecture quizzes don\'t evaluate what you\'ve learned from previous lecture material or the readings for that matter. So you just end up skipping to the answer and learning what you were supposed to answer. The projects were also interesting but had unspecified requirements that had to be clarified by the TAs constantly in Piazza and during office hours. If you don\'t pay attention to Piazza, then you are quite likely to lose 10+ points on a project you implemented according to the project\'s specifications, so pay close attention to Piazza. At least once, there was a detail provided during office hours that required many students to refactor their code even though the justification for this change was unfounded. The TAs were generally very helpful and patient in Piazza, which somewhat makes up for the instructor being completely absent. Several students who clearly just didn\'t do the work or started projects too late and did poorly, begged for a curve at the end despite the vast majority of the class getting As.

The full lessons are usually 15-25 minutes long. The professor will introduce a complex topic and spend 1-4 minutes going through it. The pentesting lecture was pathetic, honestly. It\'s nothing more than some slides name dropping tools with no input on how to use them, and the reading for the section is an entire book on pentesting. And all the lessons are this way. Network monitoring, malware analysis, etc. are all briefly plowed through with no detail or exploration. The lecture quizzes often contain questions that weren\'t covered in the lectures or the reading, which highlights how thin the actual learning material is.\nThe projects are annoying. Often times there\'s a VM you have to download and setup, but they are riddled with errors. Tons of Piazza posts troubleshooting the VMs that launch without the correct updates and are fragile.

Piazza was quite active for the most part with TA\'s/students sharing articles/papers/news outside of the course content but still related to the subject matter. I really loved the documentary related to Stuxnet that was shared - well worth a watch.\nI took the summer version - and there were 3 projects. First project was quite easy and required the use of Schneider Electric\'s SoBasic. Second project was related to the protocols that you will study during the course - Modbus/DNP3 - I personally did horrible on this one as I was in the middle of relocating between countries due to my Job. But the class median on this project was quite high so I think it would have been doable, I just did not have the time to do it properly. The third project was nice and a bit tricky also - it required knowledge of using gdb to ultimately exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability. There was a 15 point extra credit on this project also.\nExams were fair, questions did not seem ambiguous but they were extremely short. They give you 2h 50mins for the final exam that you can complete in 10 minutes - I don\'t understand the point of this. The first exam was 1 hour and frankly it had more questions where some \"thought\" was needed and there the 1 hour time was somewhat justified. Final exam is cumulative.\nComing to the pacing - I don\'t know who has decided this schedule but there\'s practically nothing that happens during the first few weeks and very little even in the first month and then you finally get something to do from the mid-term till the end. It would be really worthwhile to adjust the schedule and put two projects before the midterm instead of just one. Currently, the workload is a bad factor to judge this course on. Not saying the workload is too much, it\'s just not indicative of the reality - I don\'t think I ever spent 7 hours per week, but certainly spent 20+ hours on the 3rd project trying to figure out a silly error.\nOverall, it was a decent course. My complain is the awkward pacing and the fact that the grading is quite weird - you basically have to do great on everything. With 100% in two projects and 90% in both exams, I still ended up with only a solid B since the second project pretty much screwed me over as I got a 50%.

On the contrary, you rarely see him participating. There was a question from a student and he condescendingly answered \"I\'m not going to debate with you but for other students, my statements were right. \" That surprised and roiled up many students.

The professor runs the lectures of the course nearly directly from a technical book, with his preferences emphasized. It sometimes feels more like a survey of a wide range of industrial control topics with an emphasis on the power grid. The problem is that it\'s a poorly written book in both language and conceptual layout. For example, you find repetition of facts at the beginning, middle, and end - but all high level concepts without specifics.\nTechnical papers the professor wrote were more interesting than anything in the book, and I wish the professor focused more on his work instead of the book - \"Industrial Network Security\". There was a little bit of opinion/politics thrown into a couple lecture - and this is my ultimate pet peeve.\nNot too much detail on most topics or specific technical challenges like you will find in nearly every other OMSCS course. Two of the three projects allow for a slightly deeper dive, but still not what you would expect from your average GT graduate course. The instructor did post a few things throughout the semester on piazza, but TA involvement was puzzling. Although the TAs do answer random questions, you definitely get the feeling that the TAs have a lot better things to do than answer questions on piazza. Even with that our TAs still really seem like great people, and I liked them.\nThe hardest part of the course is having so few grading events. There are two tests and three projects. And the tests are not long, so you have to make each grade count.\nI write a review for every class I take, and this will be the first negative review for any class.

So what\'s the point? I hate courses that function like a laundry list of concepts to memorize, but if they can\'t even write unambiguous exam questions based on that list, the course is garbage. (Additionally, the lectures are just a condensed version of the book readings, rendering the readings redundant and unnecessary. ) The projects were poorly explained and there was much reliance on the student Slack channel for project setup (hint: project setup is like 90% of the work for the projects). To top it all off, the instructor was either unengaged or condescending. The course is technically \"easy\" in terms of workload and subject matter, but I would imagine that most people got B\'s just due to there being few grading events that don\'t measure your understanding very well.

After that, there\'s nothing due for a few more weeks until the Midterm that contains less than 20 multiple choice questions and is worth 25% of your grade. There is no direction on what to study, because the assessments are meant test the student\'s broad understand. This has the side effect of questions that are vague and open for interpretation, allowing multiple technically correct answers to some questions based on the level of abstraction of your interpretation.

On top of that, the VMs and instructions provided for the mini projects were very very poor and paltry when it came to details. I had to scour Piazza in order to troubleshoot some of the most basic issues with the VM (for instance, there was an Ubuntu VM given to us that had no taskbar and had I not known the command needed to use in the terminal in Piazza, I would\'ve just been completely stuck).

The SESC code base used throughout the class is horrific coming from someone who has worked in enterprise for a few years, and sadly the majority of the projects were spent just figuring out what was going on in the code vs. actually implementing and having fun measuring different aspects of the project questions. One project involved modifying the simulator in a file where ~20-30 lines of code directly pertinent to the project didn\'t even work correctly, and was effectively dead code that misled students. Luckily the main active TA Nolan was awesome, super-responsive to questions and helped clarify a lot of the confusion over Piazza. All lectures were just on a virtual whiteboard with a short intro/outro by the professor, and I would have appreciated a bit more production value like in Computer Vision where there is a mix of slides/camera angles/reading to break the monotony a bit.','Very Hard','Strongly Disliked','15 hours/week'),('CS-6290: High Performance Computer Architecture','8UY5LWwD0aaoeVq3EI6vZLwLGiA3','I was able to manage this course with no professional programming background. But you need to spend a lot of time trying to understand the code in the simulator for the projects. I think this code is basically written by hardware folks trying to get the job done in software, which is effectively what the simulator is simulating, a processor. I think the intention of the instructor is to have students spend time on understanding the code rather than give it to them on a platter with comments. If you nail the project 1, the others are just a breeze. Once you understand the flow, actual implementation should be fairly straightforward. Lectures are just awesome.

Well for the part I covered (about 55%) the course per se is not extremely hard if you strictly look only at the concepts, what makes it hard are the projects and the exams. In fact even the projects are not too hard, it is the exams I found to be particularly different from all other courses. The exams only have problem solving question with some heavy arithmetic. A lot of practice with formulas is necessary. You not only need to know your formulas but the questions will wrong-foot you at every turn. Hardly in real life we get situations where one has to do HPCA arithmetic within a quick turnaround time. And that is what this course\'s exams are about, doing HPCA arithmetic within allowed time constraints. Well I am not saying the arithmetic is not important but the course turns it into something like a race at Olympics which I think is not necessary. I would say that if you know your formulas well you can do very well in this course sometimes even if you don\'t understand the concepts well. In fact a high school student can be taught to use the formulas effectively and be made to do well in this course\'s exams.

Was never a very studious person...\nMarried w/ 2 kids under 5, full time job.\nThis was my first semester in the program, and I took this class because I was in the middle of nowhere with no Internet for the first 8 hours of my low priority registration window - so I was pretty much forced to take this class.\nI thought the lecture videos were done very well. The TA was doing his best to be helpful and was for the most part responsive, but it was clear that he was overworked. The HWs and projects were not graded in a timely manner. Half of the HWs were not graded by the end of the course (though to the TA\'s credit, he offered to consult individually for students to see where they stand in the course prior to drop date).\nThe midterm was pretty difficult. The final was made to be no-notes, no-calculator, and no-scratch paper. The result was that it was a lot of hand-wavy sort of conceptual questions (poorly-worded questions like \"what would be the more likely outcome if... \" sort of questions) - which I do not excel in as indicated in my grade in the final.\nThe projects were not too bad if you have previous C++ experience like I did. But I question the usefulness of these projects in learning the concepts. But yes - in the end, you\'re interpreting thousands of lines of code and changing 10 of them.\nI think the biggest problem is that the subject matter was just too academic for me to relate to in terms of generating excitement.

Once I understood (read: got burned by) this, I spent more time in the projects trying to make sure that I didn\'t misunderstand how the emulator worked than I did actually doing the lab.

In addition, the effort required to work with SESC and modify it was vastly out of proportion to what we were studying.

They used ProctorTrack for the test, but it was basically open book in that you could use any printed or written references, but couldn\'t use anything on your computer.

The online lectures almost go hand in hand with the books and were mostly strait forward to follow. If you are like me however, and have had no formal background in computer architecture (VLIW architecture specifically), assembly language, a good working knowledge of compilers (i\'m talking under the hood of compilers), or C++, it can be a bit intimidating at first, but it is still very doable. With a lot of reading and some external research, I was able to overcome the rather steep learning curve within the first few weeks.\nThis course was broken up into three major topics. The first is a \"review\" of computer architecture, with the emphasis being on a VLIW design philosophy. The second is a deep dive into compilers. The third section focused on four different and unique compiler optimizations (specific to embedded systems) which is the main point of the class, and really the most interesting part. The optimization portion was pretty thick with register allocation being one the most fundamental and key concepts to grasp along with lots of graphs and graph theory.\nFor the summer course we had four homework assignments, which required a bit of time and effort to complete. For at lease two of the assignments, I had to write Python scripts to aid in executing some of the algorithms used, as doing them by hand was not practical. Overall, if you go through the lectures and use the textbooks to supplement, the homework assignments are not bad, they just take a little time to complete.\nThe project was a group project, so you will need to partner up with others in the class. The project was advertised as one project broken up into two parts, which were completely unrelated, so really its two separate projects, both done with the same groups. The first project was quite the monster. We effectively made our own scheduler, which was done in C++. I had to learn C++ and do the project in parallel, so it took a bit of time. Also, the project description as written was insufficient to do the project, and do it correctly. This is really my first complaint about the class. Once you start getting into the meat of the project, you will quickly discover that there is much more that has to actually get done then appears at first glance. My recommendation is get the exact expectations from the TA\'s off the get go....for everything. The second project requires the use of a Raspberry Pi board which you will need to purchase if you don\'t already have one, and a little bit of C programming. Again, had some issues with the project description and required lots of clarification from the TAs. Also, to make things a little stressful, project due dates overlapped with due dates for HW assignments (by only a few days in both cases), so you really can\'t waste any time.\nThe projects also required the use of the Deepthought clusters at GaTech, which you will be given access to. For me, and just about the entire class, this worked for about one day after which, I lost access to and was never able to get on again. If this happens to you, don\'t waste time while the TA\'s go through the hoops of submitted trouble tickets and figure the issue out. My recommendation is to install and understand how to use Vagrant. I was able to do the projects using the Ubuntu Trusty32 box which is made available and by using the Raspberry Pi board with Raspbian installed.\nThe final exam was the only exam for the class, and was not easy. It was cumulative in nature and took a good bit of time for me to complete.\nLastly, second and really my main frustration for this course was the TA\'s. Going into the final exam, Piazza at a glance looked something like 40 unread post, 17 unanswered questions, and 34 unresolved followups (actual stats). Piazza was like a ghost town, and the TA\'s were the ghosts. Usually 2-3 day turnaround time to get a question answered, and it was usually some vague one sentence answer which wasn\'t useful. You will rely on your classmates in Piazza to be successful. To be fair, the TA\'s were very reasonable with grades and everything was graded fairly.\nOverall, I actually did enjoy the class as I found the material quite fascinating. I think the class would be easier if you went in well versed in C++, have taken a computer architecture course, and are comfortable with assembly language and assembly notation. The class could be improved if the project descriptions were rewritten and the TA\'s were a bit more involved on Piazza. If they fixed these issues, I think this class has the potential to be awesome. Also, for someone with such little prerequisite knowledge, I did very well in the class.','Medium','Liked','15 hours/week'),('CS-6291: Embedded System Optimization','RnOwfjcbIicockYRPl5Y59Zo5rJ2','This course covers compiler optimizations for embedded systems.\nThe punchline is that when you compile a program for a desktop operating system, you\'re not sure what exact processor the application is actually going to be run on. Because of this, desktop processors offer a fairly generic interface: your compiler creates machine code that can be run on a desktop processor in general, and specific processors then optimize that machine code dynamically according to the features of that processor. But when you\'re developing an application for an embedded microprocessor you usually know the exact specs of the microprocessor that your code will be running on: your compiler can optimize your code to that particular microprocessor, taking that burden off of the microprocessor, allowing the microprocessor to run more quickly and consume less energy.\nIf you\'re interested in that, then this course is very interesting and illuminating. Despite my issues with the course, I enjoyed it. And you can read other reviews under the former course number: \"CS-8803-004: Embedded Software\".\nFor the summer class, we had four homework assignments, two group projects, and a final. The homework assignments took me 5-10 hours each. The first group project--scheduling 4-wide VLIW code from a 1-wide sample--took me about 30 hours. The second group project--compiling media benchmarks to a RaspberryPi target and profiling the results--took me 10-15 hours. The final focused on the material covered by the homeworks and projects: I didn\'t focus any final-study on anything that wasn\'t in the homeworks or projects and I did well on the final. Like other reviewers, I wrote Python scripts to help me solve a couple of homework problems that would have taken too long to solve manually: when the assignment would ask for a \"best\" solution and there were many possible permutations, I wrote scripts. Where the projects required an Ubuntu machine, I performed my work on a local VM rather than using the GATech Deepthought cluster.\nIn some cases, the TAs were very helpful, and in some cases they weren\'t very helpful. Grading on a few of the homeworks/projects was very fast and efficient. In other cases, grading was slow and frustrating. In particular, the students disputed two or three \"correct\" answers in the first homework. To the TA\'s credit, they followed up and credited the responses that we demonstrated to be correct.\nBut in general, especially in our first homework, both projects, and our final, we did a lot of puzzling out exactly what was being asked for, or sorting through incorrect instructions. The final in particular took me almost the entire three hours for trying to decipher the questions: there were grammatical errors, poor formatting, unclear instructions--especially about what parts of our work and/or solution needed to be written down--and actual errors in the questions that made it difficult to complete the test. I did well, so I\'m confident that I wasn\'t just misunderstanding the questions.\nIn general, the course feels \"rough\". If you look back over all of the course reviews--under both course numbers--that\'s the consensus. Well, that\'s fine enough for the first couple of runs, but this course has now been running for a couple of years. So I\'m a bit frustrated at that. But ultimately I did enjoy the course and I did feel like I learned a lot.','Medium','Liked','12 hours/week'),('CS-6291: Embedded System Optimization','WIpoDbrHW2VD5P2zA5XzyP4PSGB2','Overview\nThis was my second class in OMSCS and with no prior experience in computer architecture, assembly, C++ or compiler theory, I found it challenging. As others have stated, the course starts with computer architecture with a focus on VLIW then moves to compilers and wraps up with optimization techniques. I found it very interesting to learn the differences between RISC and CISC processors as well as the VLIW processor design philosophy. Embedded processors are everywhere (cars, phones, network equipment, control systems, etc.) and their unique power and performance requirements drive a much different processor design. In particular, embedded processors rely the compiler to do many of the optimizations that would typically be done on-chip in a desktop processor. Professor Pande clearly has passion in this area and several of the optimizations presented in the last part of the class are based on research that he has published in collaboration with others.\nProjects\nThere are 2 projects in the course, and they are both done with a partner. You will be asked to pair up on your own so be sure to jump on Piazza as soon as this process starts so that you don\'t get left in the dust. The first project was to build a scheduler which would take assembly-like input (VEX), build a graph data structure and then produce a parallel schedule. This project required C++. The second project really required more analysis and little to no coding. You will be benchmarking a couple of programs on the Raspberry Pi and then determining which functions should optimized. Although I absolutely love tinkering with the Raspberry Pi, I didn\'t find this project interesting at all. One of the whiz kids in my class gave a detailed post about how one of the design goals of recent ARM processors was to completely eliminate the need to perform the sort of analysis that we were asked to do. The instructions for the second project were particularly poor and several fundamental questions went completely unanswered by the TAs. This is maybe the biggest area that could be improved.\nNOTE: As others have mentioned, the project instructions talk about using the DeepThought system to compile and run your code but this is a complete waste of time. The entire thing can be done from a VM on your local machine and DeepThought is fraught with issues. I strongly recommend that you do not waste a single second on DeepThought. I suspect the TAs were new this semester and will help you avoid this pitfall in the future by updating the instructions.\nHomework\nThere are 4 homework assignments which each took a bit of time to complete. Homework 2 required C++ programming but all the other assignments were theory only. I found it helpful to have a good diagramming tool (Lucidchart in my case) since several of the questions asked us to produce visualizations.\nFinal Exam\nI thought the comprehensive final was fair but there were a few mistakes in the instructions that left me hoping the question would be thrown out. We were given 3 hours and I needed the whole time to complete. I think the homework assignments and lectures helped to prepare me, although I didn\'t read a couple of the assigned papers and I\'m confident that hurt me.\nSummary\nThe content of this class was interesting and helped me fill in some gaps from my undergrad (computer architecture, assembly and compiler theory). Project 1 was fun but Project 2 felt completely obsolete and poorly supported. The homework assignments were a bit time consuming but manageable. Overall I would recommend the course.','Hard','Liked','15 hours/week'),('CS-6291: Embedded System Optimization','nDs6JQPklgNAStad8d9OzgwxB2h1','Just finished up Embedded Systems for the Summer of 2018. As an embedded hardware engineer, and having a strong hardware background in school, I found this class absolutely fascinating. It sort of fills a lot of \"low level gaps\" that you don\'t ever really think about when it comes compiling code for embedded hardware. You will definitely need a strong C/C++ background going into this class. Other classes that I had under my belt from undergrad that helped me were Digital Logic, Digital Design, and Microprocessors. Working as a full time professional, I found the work load manageable.\nI am not sure how this class flows during a normal spring / fall semester, but the summer semester it did feel pretty condensed and very quick pace, there was absolutely no down time in between lectures, projects, and home works. The home works and projects overlapped. During the first project, i had to stop working it, get the one of the homeworks done, and then pick the project back up, which i found kind of annoying. If you think you might need a slower pace, I would recommend taking this class in the fall or spring.\nThe lectures were done very well. Dr. Santosh is very thorough, clear, and concise. There were a few errors in some of the lectures, but they were usually pretty obvious when you came across them, and there was an erratta provided to give you a heads up. The lectures followed the reading material very well, which included the textbooks, and the assigned academic papers (some written by the professor himself). The class is very well organized and broken down into 3 distinct sections:\nReview of Computer Architecture and crash course into VLIW design philosophy.\nCompilers Compilers Compilers. Front end and back end.\nCompiler Optimizations (my favorite part of the class).\nThe very first lecture you dive head first into assembly language, if you have never had any experience with assembly, you might have some catching up to do, but i dont think it would be too overwhelming. This class assumes you have a working knowledge with the fundamental processor architecture building blocks, such as ALU\'s, IR\'s, Registers, Memory, Program Counters ect... so the first section is a pretty quick refresher, but it doesn\'t really go into the hardcore nuts and bolts of how an ALU works for example. Parts 2 and 3 use a ton of graph theory, and a ton of graph theory algorithms , which i found fascinating. I had almost NO background in graph theory, and I was able to manage just fine.\nFor the summer semester, we had 4 homeworks and 1 project broken down into two different parts. The projects were pretty distinct from each other, so it felt like two separate projects rather than 1 project. Both projects were group projects. The home works were pretty straight forward, they pulled from the reading material and lectures, but they were pretty involved. When the homeworks get into the graph theory, I found myself writing programs to help solve the problems as they are not very practical to do by hand. For this, i mostly used Python. Homeworks were \"pen and paper\" style.\nThe first project was the most intense part of the entire course. It was done in C++. I work mostly in C, so brushing up on my C++ was pretty quick, if you haven\'t had either, you will be at a disadvantage. I easily spent more hours on this project than I did on all 4 homeworks and project 2 combined, and then some. Enter my first complaint of the course: the project 1 description. it was vague, ambiguous, impervious to clarity, and riddled with copy/paste errors. I am not saying this to just complain, it really was pretty bad. It needs to be revised (See other reviews of this class, they will say the same thing). The TA\'s were basically absent from piazza to to provide clarification, which was pretty frustrating. I had asked for clarification on one of the requirements via the project description (which was unclear), and I did not receive a response until the night before the project was due, by then I had already \"made an assumption\", which ended up being incorrect. I had also already turned the project in, which I had to redo a pretty good chunk of my code and resubmit, which was absolutely miserable. The Deepthought Clusters stopped working about 2 days into the project, and this issue was never resolved. To overcome this, I ended up just putting vagrant on my machine and avoided using Deepthought all together. Some students wasted a good bit of time with service tickets / requests to no avail and a lot of wasted time. Despite all of this, I absolutely loved the project, it makes practical, a lot of theory and gives you a lot of appreciation for it.\nProject 2 was pretty straight forward, and had an open ended element to it, which opened the door for creativity, which i really appreciated. For this project you needed to purchase a raspberry pi board, as the focus of the project was around ARM processors. This project was mostly analysis and very little coding, it did, however, seem to be sort of dated, as we were not using the most up to date ARM compiler. Not as interesting as the first project. Project description again, lacked in clarity one certain parts, some of which were never clarified by the TA\'s. Deepthought still was an issue, and by this point , I think everyone was just using Vagrant.\nThe final exam was pretty terrible. For being 33% of your entire grade, and the only exam, it was a little bit stressful. It was cumulative, so it was a ton of material that it covered. I didnt really know what to expect. It is done via Proctor Track, which i felt like was completely inadequate for how they expected you to enter your responses. There were also mistakes on the actual exam questions, which i was hoping they were going to throw out, but I dont think they did. It was 3 hours, and it took most of the time to complete.\nMy only other complaint with this class was the TA\'s, as i hinted above. Im not sure if they were just super busy or what, but they were just not around at all. Being a smaller class size, the student to student interaction was definitely not as active as other larger classes I have had, but the TA\'s EASILY averaged a 2-3 day turnaround time with questions. Probably the worse TA experience I have had in the OMSCS program to date.\nGrading was done very fairly.\nOverall, I thought this class was pretty great, and recommend it for any hardware guys out there. This class certainly has a lot of potential, and is certainly one of my favorites in the OMSCS program. I think if they were to clean up the project descriptions, and just avoid Deepthought all together, it could be improved.','Hard','Loved!','20 hours/week'),('CS-6291: Embedded System Optimization','yFnUXa2MjoNG4OvvDn4DV3SG12v2','This was my 7th class in the program, and by far my least favorite. The homeworks were fine, straightforward enough but the answer keys were never given. This made it very difficult to study for the final when it was unclear what the correct answers were to some of the homework questions. The first project was building a scheduler for VLIW code and I think I learned more about C++ (had never used it before) than actually scheduling. The second project used a Raspberry Pi and to be honest - was incredibly pointless. If you do enough research into what the project is asking you do to, you\'ll realize that it is completely obsolete. The exam had a lot of weird questions and typos that made the questions even more confusing and was pretty poorly written.\nThe biggest annoyance I had with this class was the lack of responses from the TAs on Piazza. It would take days to weeks to get a response to a simple question, and most questions were left unanswered past the due dates for projects or homeworks that they were asking about. Even at the end of the semester there were almost 40 unread/unanswered posts.\nOverall, I would not recommend this course until the revamp the homework/projects/test.','Medium','Disliked','5 hours/week'),('CS-6291: Embedded System Optimization','pdQpZcnRPxO2YTfYt9FsKNUPgWe2','Looks like this is the first review of the course, but it\'s just because it used to be 8803 - see the one with embedded in the name for some relevant reviews.\nI really liked the course, and a lot of it had to do with the main TA\'s involvement on Piazza.

I believe this is the first time this class has been offered online. After another semester or two, once the kinks are worked out, I could see this being a very good class.\nMy biggest complaint with this class was definitely with the first (group) project. It felt like my group spent as much time trying to parse the project description and figure out the project requirements as actually complete the project. On the last weekend before it was due, we probably spent a combined 45-50 man-hours (on a 3-person team) trying to complete it and still didn\'t finish. I think the instructors realized that the project was more difficult than they anticipated, because they ended up grading it very generously (I received full credit even though the project was incomplete).

If you\'re looking for a class about embedded systems/software, this isn\'t for you. This class is really about code size vs execution, optimizations you can do, when it makes sense to do said optimizations, and coming-up-with/discussing/profiling several heuristics around those optimizations.\nThe lectures themselves were only alright, but the projects were phenomenal.','Hard','Liked','15 hours/week'),('CS-6300: Software Development Process','g4f0CHMh6DVOBQpL1Gd2bAJSGTc2','I am slightly surprised that so many people rate this class highly. It\'s kind of disappointing in many ways. The head TA on repeated occasions (I won\'t out them by name here) is condescending and frankly never helpful. Their responses to Piazza posts (and given the fact that they answer the majority of posts) actively discouraged me from ever engaging with Piazza because I was concerned about asking a question that felt \"stupid\" or simple.\nThe projects are probably the worst part about the course. Many of them are simple, quick assignments that can be completed in a few hours if you have some Java knowledge. However, the layout and structuring around the projects (and the individual project itself) is a nuisance. The major issue is the assignment time frame. I took the course in the summer term, so the full semesters may be different. Each assignment was released on a Saturday and then due the following Saturday (7 days). No exceptions or previews. This means that if you have something come up for work, another class, etc. then good luck. You still have the same time frame. Not all classes in OMSCS give info ahead of time about projects. But when you expect students to turnaround an assignment in a single 7 day time window, there should be some level of foresight given upfront so they can plan for things. I had multiple occasions where I had to rush and turn in a subpar assignment because on Monday morning my work commitments would pile up for the week and I was left to choose between slacking off at my job or skimping on a course assignment.\nThe second major issue with the projects is that they are structured in an order which can actually hurt you later. For example, there\'s a project around the 4th or 5th project that requires you to build a testing suite around a program that doesn\'t actually exist, and you aren\'t supposed to implement the program. However, in the individual project (which is 20% of the course grade), you are then expected to implement the program AND it must pass your test suite from weeks prior without making any changes to the test suite. This means that if you misunderstood a requirements, didn\'t plan for something, etc. in the earlier project, then you\'d potentially harm yourself in the later assignment (as you may have incorrect test cases based on assumptions at that point that you aren\'t allowed to change). Why is this necessary? It just seems like poor planning for the course structure.\nThe final issue with the projects is that some of them simply feel watered down and unhelpful. The second part of the individual project involved the instructions saying that you had to change your program from part 1 because of \"updated customer requirements\". In the real world, this happens. But in a graduate level course, what justifies this as an assignment? It is hard to see how that part of the project is anything more than busy work.\nGrading is slow and obtuse. They have a ton of students and about 6-7 TAs. The rough math comes out to 40-50 students per TA, which is actually about average for many courses. I am a TA for a course that has an assignment of about 45 students per TA. In SDP, they don\'t release grades for weeks. 8 weeks into the course, they have only finished grades for the first 4 (out of about 10-12) assignments. There is only a week left in the official course. So, they are considerably slower at grading than other courses in OMSCS, and don\'t expect feedback about earlier parts of large assignments before you complete the later parts. They also don\'t give any details about the grading for projects, so don\'t expect to understand where your grade comes from until the release grades, either.\nFinally, the course material is fine. If you have any experience in software development, it is going to seem basic and boring. There\'s nothing new or novel covered in the course. In fact, I honestly would put the course on par with an undergraduate SE course. It\'s inoffensive, and there is a grade for completing the quizzes so they \"force\" you to go through the materials. There are no exams, however, so there\'s no pressure to actually pay attention and absorb the material (unless you don\'t have any SE background and the material is new to you).

It would take about 5 hours a week at most to take care of everything due for that week. The only exception to this was the group project. Despite the compressed schedule during the summer there were times I felt like I wasn\'t taking any class at all. The class covers the software development lifecycle and testing methodologies but never really goes in depth into any of the topics. As a result you will walk away with a basic familiarity of the material but nothing more. If you have absolutely no development experience this can be useful but I don\'t see much value in this course for anyone who has even a little bit of experience. The grading was very slow and as I write this having turned in my last project there is still about 50% of the work left to grade. The instructor is very enthusiastic and explains the material well.

Groups were assigned based on mutually available meeting times and complementary Java experience, which worked out great!\nCONS: Assignment grades were consistently very late. I literally had no idea how I was doing in the course for the first half of the semester. (As a new student, this was particularly unsettling!) The instructors take grading very seriously, and go to lengths to ensure fairness by making sure grade distribution from TA to TA isn\'t skewed, releasing all grades simultaneously, and so on. I do prefer a fair grade over a fast grade, so I appreciated this. However, I think it\'s also reasonable to expect timely qualitative feedback, perhaps with a delayed quantitative grade.

The assignments are completed in Java, the projects are based on creating Android Apps, and you use Git. I had never used Java, built an Android App, or used Git so it took me considerably more time than most because I had to learn those concepts as a went, but I would still say it\'s low difficulty.

The projects were sufficiently entertaining and educational. Some prior OO and GUI programming experience will go a long way to eliminating any frustrations with this class.\nThe group project experience depends largely on the project partners who are assigned to you. I worked with excellent individuals, and the 4 of us just automagically dove into our imagined roles and pounded out a project with a good score. Though there is a mechanism to adjust scoring should there be inequities in contribution from the other group partners (or so I\'ve heard).\nBased on conversations with others, there were additional projects that are now in place where they weren\'t present previously in prior summer semesters.

The group project can be either very easy or very hard depending on your group - in my case, it wound up being incredibly time consuming (>40 hours one week because I had two absentee group members). I wouldn\'t recommend taking this course in the summer for just that reason - I don\'t think they scale the project back for the accelerated schedule, and one bad week of coordination can tank your schedule.\nThe lectures are informative and well-done. The professor and TAs are very involved with the class, and I\'d take another course from Orso in a heartbeat.\nIf it\'s been a while since you\'ve worked as a software engineer in a modern environment, this is a great course.

You write a lot of docs, code the project, then backfill your docs with what really happened. You create one really useful diagram that makes you think, and a ton of expository writing that just fills pages. So, a lot like any highly regulated domain. This presumably forms the core of the class.\nHowever, in summer, you get the thrill of concurrent group and individual assignments. The individual assignments contain a lot of \"aha!\" moments that can take hours or days to find. But you don\'t have hours or days - you spent those on Android. I bet these individual assignments carry meaning in a longer term. In summer, they stand in the way. The course lectures don\'t have the information or the presentation quality to pull off \"aha\" assignments. Most of what you need, you find googling. And you don\'t share what you find because you never know how close you walk the line of distributing unfair information.\nI would have felt much happier ignoring the lectures and spending that time on the individual assignments. Really, they do not help.\nLast point (completely serious): The instructors do not believe in the western tradition of starting things on Monday. They live in an alternate calendar.

There is no major challenge to the projects themselves, as they aren\'t designed to test you on your ability to solve problems, just how well you follow process and complete documentation (which isn\'t a complaint, that\'s the point of the class!). Unfortunately, there wasn\'t much engagement in the process beyond wrote tasks and standard documentation. Since the projects are fairly trivial, it seems silly to spend so much time on design and discussion, so hopefully in the future they use projects that are a bit more complex, or maybe having to deal with changing requirements or incomplete requirements. That being said, if you don\'t have any experience in software development or process, this is probably a good introduction to it.\nIf I were to give advice to those taking the class, I would say two things:\nBe careful with your time, the Summer section was quite fast-paced, and it is easy to fall behind. The instructors insist on making things due on Friday, and make things very awkward for those who work. You can get some of the projects done on the weekend they open, but Piazza comments and project errata will appear during the week, so you still have to work around your weekday schedule unfortunately!\nCheck your work over until you feel paranoid about it. The instructors are not very compassionate nor understanding when it comes to simple mistakes. I personally was only affected by this once at the very beginning of the course, but two of my teammates lost a full letter grade due to this.

Getting an introduction to Android was also great.\nConsidering the ambiguous nature of the rest of the classes I\'ve taken, SDP is now engraved in my mind as a sweet memory.

If you have programmed in an OO language before, this class is a huge waste of your time. Several of the projects are tedious and are of limited value to programming In Real Life.\nExample: In one project the assignment asks you to write 30 black-box test cases for \"test-driven development\" - when you have the source code (that you wrote) right in front of you. Actual worthwhile tests that you might write in industry are frowned upon. The standard \"red-green-refactor\" is barely mentioned in one lecture, and never really asked for in any assignment.\nGrading is unbelievably slow. Assignment feedback (when you get it) is random and worthless. If you want an easy foundational class, go for it. If you want to learn something useful, avoid.

The only assignment that I really wish were reviewed was the Category-Partition testing assignment.

The class met these expectations, but relied on some outdated information and documentation that is not actually used in the real world industry.\nThe course was a great overview of what it takes to develop software from the systems or business side of things. Not just the guts of programming. The course takes you through the steps from initial concept, requirements gathering, documenting designs for approvals, prototyping, reviewing designs again, implementation, testing, and final presentation\\shipment for a software project.\nThe class leans more towards requirement gathering and documentation then programming, so be prepared for that.\nThe course had almost no flaws in it, besides the team picking process and getting the students to work together, but that is a separate issue. The TAs and professor were very helpful and willing to see the students learn the material.\nAs others have mentioned, while this is a decent course for those who are not good programmers, you still need to be able to program to take this course.

Grading is very fair although one of my complaints in a lot of these lower level classes is that roughly 50% of the class gets 100% on assignments and then there is a steep drop off. You either aced the testing criteria the TA / Professor had in place or you lose 10, 15, 30%. I would rather see an actual bell curve where very few students get 100% even if the majority get 90+.\nBesides the group project, all of the programming required is on par with sophomore level programming classes especially if you have any Java experience. For the other assignments such as defining test cases, diagrams, etc. I only found about 20-30% of it actually value added but I appreciate being exposed to these various tools even if at the end of the day I didn\'t find many of them useful in the real world.\nFor the group project, as many others have mentioned, it is very dependent on your teammates. That being said, you can do yourself a big favor by assigning tasks based on individual skills, don\'t try to break it up \"evenly\" or \"fairly\". If one member of your team writes android applications professionally there is nothing wrong with having that person write the entire app themselves.

We were not allowed to select our groups so you have to make the best of what you are given.\nThe four weaknesses of the course were 1) VERY slow turnaround with grading. 2) The rubrics were not published and some of the grading seemed a bit nit-picky. There was one case in particular where instructions for a deliverable weren\'t entirely clear, yet grading was strict on that section. 3) I was a bit disappointed with the final project since it wasn\'t something one would ever encounter in the real-world, and it did not add much to what we had already learned in the class during the semester. 4) The Friday midnight deadlines were rough, especially since office hours weren\'t until Weds evening. Would have preferred a Saturday midnight deadline so that some of the weekend could be used to finish things up after office hours.\nBottom line is that you will leave this course with a good understanding of the pros and cons of different development approaches.

I have only a sliver of a Java background, and this was enough to get through the paper just fine.\nThis course covers things like using an IDE and git.

Overall, I would definitely recommend taking this course and think it is a doable amount of work for a summer semester. P. S.

So your experience in this course depends to a large extent on the group you were placed in. I had a great experience with my group however I am aware that this was not the case universally. GATech make an effort to place at least one experienced Java dev in each group so even if you are not particularly strong in programming, you can fill another role in the group such as testing and/or documentation. There are individual programming assignments as well however these are considerably easier than the group projects. The overall progression of the assignments simulated a typical system development lifecycle project (with a RAD twist) with all the associated deliverables; systems requirements doc, prototype, test case doc, UML model, user manual, etc. I found that it was possible to deliver the assignments without really watching the lectures however part of your grade is based on your completion of the udacity quizzes so I guess this encourages you to watch all the lectures.

The course instructor was one of the most engaging though which made it an alright experience. As others have commented the group work is awful, there is such a huge gap in experience and certain team members carry the lions share of the burden. I understand it\'s trying to represent \'real-world\' work where you have to collaborate with a team, but in the real world you don\'t have people with so little programming experience who are still gainfully employed, and quite frankly the \'project-manager\' role for the project doesn\'t have an equitable share of the work.','Easy','','3 hours/week'),('CS-6300: Software Development Process','c36c1a3f-6655-4f31-b0a4-971fdc87fbe6','My java skills were entirely not up to snuf.

It is easy to get an A but I did not get very much learning out of it, which is why I am doing this program in the first place. On weeks when assignment was due, you can cram it out and on other weeks that don\'t have anything due, there would be almost no work except watch some videos.

There is no slack channel for concept discussion and questions.\nAssignments take a LONG time trade. Since it takes forever for you to get your assignment back, and even when you do get it back, you don\'t get any feedback so you don\'t know if what you did was actually correct or not, even though you got a decent grade. Because of that, I went through the entire course not knowing what things I did right or wrong. Up to this point I still do not know what I did for my assignments were correct or not, it was all \"my best guess, and what made sense for me\", but it would be very helpful to see other ways of doing the assignments, what to do and what not to do.\nFinal project was just kind of thrown at you and he tells you to just go do it. There is no progression or guide in how to do the project so it is overwhelming at first, especially if you don\'t have very experienced team members. Also absolutely no feedback for our final project. We spent 85% of our time doing the database which was worth 15 points and we ended up getting 0/15 for some unknown reason. We message the TA and professor and we get no response. It is just so unprofessional.\nLecture materials apparently are very important concepts but videos do not go over many examples or go in depth to explain anything, how to implement concepts, how the concept compares to another solution. The professor presents the material and thats it. If someone like me has never heard or ever seen what the professor is talking about, I do no learning.\nTips:\nTry to meet up with local students and discuss over topics in lectures and homework requirements (of course following the collaboration policy).

The group project was the only thing that required scheduling, but if you have a good group like I did then it\'s not a problem; plus it was an obscenely small % of the total grade. The periodic assignments, class participation, and peer feedback was a large percentage, and they were very manageable.\nThis class went through the motions hitting all the key beats, but focusing mostly on UML class diagrams and state charts. It then touched on and required us to generate behavior diagrams and a deployment diagram. There were periodic assignments requiring various diagrams to be generated for various designs, and then there was a group project. The group project was based on a scenario described in a prior assignment, so the initial work consisted of reviewing the group members\' class diagrams and code and combining all the best parts (or picking someone\'s who got a good grade). All of that was fine.\nThen there was a surprisingly large amount of coding. It was my first time having to write Java in 10 years or so, and I was surprised, considering design can 100% be done without writing code. Either way, as you can see from my rating, it was pretty easy overall, but I would just be warned that there is significant coding required. Also the videos were weird; I didn\'t think they were bad at the time, but having taken a couple more classes since I can see they weren\'t great. Also, they didn\'t always have anything to do with what we were actually generating for the assignments and the project, but the state chart ones were OK.','Easy','Neutral','5 hours/week'),('CS-6310: Software Architecture & Design','3ujo5fcHXJhVG4yjNShDPdU6Kmb2','This was my first class, and it was a good introduction to the program.

The issue is we turned in design2 and implementation2 without feed back from the 1st assignments. This was an ongoing issue.

The instructors manually graded the 1st assignments but then used an autograder for assignment2 implementation.

The material itself is not very difficult, and I enjoyed the subject topics covered. The lectures were very informative and to the point, though at times a bit dated. The professor states how it is hard to teach design, as design is best learned by doing. Yet most of the assignments were short 7 page research papers on various subjects, when smaller programming assignments or design problems would have been a better choice.

I understand that these large online classes tend to have a less than ideal student to grader ratio. But it took a VERY long time to get feedback on turned in assignments. Sometimes grades would come back without feedback, leaving me wondering why I got points off. There were several assignments that were not returned before the final exam or before the last project were due, which would have been extremely useful for the completion of those two. Throughout the semester it was hard, if not impossible, to tell how well you were doing because we didn\'t have any graded assignments returned, even though some were due 1+ months prior! The TAs also seemed to avoid questions on Piazza asking about when we would receive grades back, or just give an answer saying they did not know.\nGroup projects. BEWARE OF GROUP PROJECTS. The assignments for this class were mostly all done in groups. At the start of the semester the group forming process was not made clear whatsoever. We were asked to make 1 min long intro videos about ourselves and our experience, which I assumed would be used to help form groups. But we never saw them. When the first group assignment came out, we had to use Piazza to try to hastily form a group. And as it turned out, that was the group we had to use for the entire semester. If I had known that, I would have taken more care into the selection of my group members. Most of the assignments ended up being research papers, but the last major project required significant software development. KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN SELECTING YOUR GROUP!! Other members of my group were not well versed in software development, while I am. This left me to do a huge portion of the project just due to time constraints and my previous experience.

However, to my pleasant surprise, it was a course on newer technologies (what? things have changed since I got my degree 25 years ago?) and how to leverage those technologies to effectively test and track down issues in software. The lectures (on Udacity) were well done for the most part. The quizzes (in Udacity to test your knowledge) could have been clearer, but I took them a few times to get a better understanding. No textbook. All the materials are through Udacity, though there are PDF and Powerpoint equivalents for you to study offline. There were 7 projects and for each one, a video intro is provided as well as a PDF providing detailed instructions on how to implement the project. The instructors provide a VirtualBox VM to use for all of the projects and I found it well put-together. Instructors (professor + TAs) were readily available and supportive. Knowledge of C or C++ comes in handy for a couple of the projects (pointer arithmetic). Projects require minimal coding in either C, Java, or scripting, along with one project using datalog. Lots of support through Piazza forum + slack channel. Office Hours were done using Google hangouts and if you missed it, you could play it back.\nWhen it came to the midterm and final, while a practice midterm and practice final were available, I felt they weren\'t representative to the exam itself. The midterm practice exam was actually harder than the actual exam (that\'s ideal, I\'m overprepared), while the final preparation left me feeling overconfident since the final was much harder than the practice final exam.\nOverall, I enjoyed the course and have many new skills that I\'m looking forward to putting to use on future development projects.','Medium','Liked','14 hours/week'),('CS-6340: Software Analysis & Test','pZKf9jBBvUehSjdHvZJKaYjh6hq2','I completed SA&T the summer of 2018 as my fourth course in OMSCS and will say it was the most well-directed, organized, and supported course I have taken in the program so far. The instructor and TAs had great attitudes about the class and material and were active and helpful on Piazza and Slack. The lectures were understandable, interesting, and directly related to the labs and exams. The labs were prepared very well with an almost flawless VM. Preparing each lab\'s file structure on the VM and collecting the deliverables was not painful but not seamless either. The exams were fair but challenging.\nThe course material has a heavy emphasis on Software Analysis vice Test. While the majority of the material is still interesting and was mostly in line with my expectations, I was hoping for more material on best practices of testing in the industry. The third and fourth lab (Dataflow and Datalog) were quite challenging, and full understanding is needed for a good grade on the exams as well. Dataflow and Datalog are worthwhile topics, but I would have benefited from more complex examples or references of these topics.\nOverall I would highly recommend taking this course. Being familiar but not fully proficient with C, C++, Java and bash scripting was enough background that I felt comfortable with the course prerequisite knowledge. I ended up with a B because I put the hours in for the labs and did just well enough on the exams.

I got stuck on several projects and his hints were instrumental in me doing well on (and completing) the projects. As long as Chris is part of this course, I recommend taking it, but you really need to be familiar with C/C++--at a minimum, I recommend taking IOS (CS6200) as a prerequisite (also an excellent course with an excellent professor); in addition, go through the Essential C/C++ course on Lynda.com.

Some courses (IOS when I took the first run of it in Spring 2015) are a little looser when applying the honor code, but most courses are so strict with it that it makes public Piazza and Slack help request/question posts pretty much pointless.

I fail to see how they can be any use once you move outside of academia. Second half teaches you tools that may actually be useful, but less than 50% good does not make up for the horrid 50%. Assignments: Extremely frustrating. Some assignments are extremely easy while the some are very difficult, not because you learn some difficult yet interesting concept, but because they are designed to be - otherwise all the assignments will take only a few hours to complete. Most assignments are auto-graded, so if you have typos in your typed answer don\'t expect any leniency. There\'s no Slack chat for the class - again if one existed the assignments would have been super easy. Some can be completed by \"throwing random inputs at the wall and see what sticks\", which is actually a valid testing framework, according to some lecture. Lectures: Difficult concepts are skimped, while lecturer spends a lot of time explaining obvious, common-sense concepts. Lectures are mostly disconnected with assignments. Expect maybe 10 minutes of useful materials and 30 minutes of filler contents, and unlike ESPN the filler contents can give you a coma. Examples are not adequate so the office hours are mandatory if you want to understand what\'s going on, which you really don\'t since....

I went in not knowing C++ and we ended up having an assignment written in that language with a special framework that I got a 30 on because I had to spend so much time just trying to figure out the language and the corresponding special framework that I barely got around to actually figuring out the concept behind the assignment. Don\'t make my mistakes.\nClass material: There were definitely some interesting and useful concepts sprinkled in, but I work in this field and had never heard of most of the concepts/testing techniques in this class. Either my company is just really terrible at testing, or a lot of these techniques are outdated, far too specific, or not used in the actual business world, and I think it\'s the latter. There was some material that was very useful, but many of the lectures were incredibly boring and slow-moving. Lots of time was spent on background and not as much on the actual concepts.\nAssignments: This is what killed the class for me. Assignments were either ridiculously easy (an hour or two) or impossibly difficult (30+ hours, and the majority were like this). There were 7 total and I came to dread each release of a new assignment. For me, they felt like an enormous leap from the lectures and I felt completely lost for the first third of the time spent on the tough ones. Provided resources were extremely limited and lacked detail, and the concepts nearly always couldn\'t be found anywhere on the web, so I had to rely on asking the other students and TAs on Piazza for everything I couldn\'t understand, which was frustrating. Overall the assignments tested our ability to figure out what we are supposed to do with the tiniest scraps of information as possible rather than our understanding of the concepts from class, so they felt like a huge and infuriating waste of time.\nExams: The midterm was tough but I felt it was pretty fair. We were given a practice exam for both the midterm and final and I felt the practice gave a good feel for what the real exam is like. The class average was a 65 on the midterm, but the grades were curved soon afterwards. The exams are open-lecture notes.\nProfessors/TAs: One of our professors was very dedicated, consistent with office hours, and was always on Piazza helping out and answering questions. The other professor who recorded the lectures showed up for one office hours, which were supposed to be weekly, and then cancelled each week after that before finally not scheduling them at all and being replaced by rotating TAs. The TAs were helpful and seemed dedicated to helping the students, and they seem like they had to carry a lot of the weight, so I commend them for that.\nThis was my first class in the entire program and it had me questioning whether the program was right for me.

This class can take a lot of time depending on your background. Don\'t let the average workload fool you. My background academic experience consisted of predominately electrical engineering courses sprinkled with skeleton computer science code problems during my undergraduate program. My current job is a System Administrator and I hardly touch code. I can definitely say I this class took a lot of time due to my background. If you are like me and you don\'t have a decent amount of software development experience, I would recommend taking SDP before this class. You definitely don\'t have to take Software Development Process before this one to excel, but I believe SDP would give you the exposure of typical bugs software engineers/software developers would encounter. This exposure would give the student a deeper appreciation of techniques presented in this course. I believe anyone can take this class and do well if you work hard; however, to shave off time of some of the projects it will serve you well to have a solid grasp of C/C++ i.e pointers, pass-by-reference, STL, etc. and Java, some graph theory terminology i.e. node, edge, path, directed etc, algorithms of common data structures such as trees, linked lists, and arrays, very basic probability and statistics, and all of the common operations from Set Theory.

All horror assignments alluded to in previous semesters have been removed. Some tools were specific to academic research and not necessarily widely used in industry, which may not be beneficial for some students.

Once you endure through the learning curve, you realize the simplicity of the coding for all but one assignment that required a specific algorithm that I hadn\'t implemented before.

Mid-term and final exams tested concepts from the lectures, were straightforward and fair. There were no trick questions. If you paid attention during lectures, took notes, and spent the time to understand the concepts, you would do exceedingly well (I scored in the 90%s for both mid-term and final; it can be done!). In fact, for a couple questions in the final exam, the answers were directly in the lecture notes, and so you could literally just copy and paste!\nThe lectures were excellent and provided all of the (basic) fundamentals to work on the assignments, and you would fill in any gaps by reading the required readings mentioned in the assignment instructions. Again, if you took notes during lectures, and did the readings, then the assignments would feel straightforward. This doesn\'t mean that they were easy, but at least you wouldn\'t get entangled in the concepts, and would instead be able to tackle the \"puzzle\" head on. The documentations on the libraries/frameworks/tools were sufficient and clear.\nIn summary, this is an excellent class on static and dynamic analyses. In addition to the application, it covers theoretical aspects: does an analysis terminate; is it complete; is it sound; can we do better, and if so, what the trade-offs would be? You will learn a ton, and end up with a deeper appreciation of static/dynamic analyses--the sort of things compilers and IDEs do to optimize/analyze your code.

They don\'t teach you on how to use testing tools out there in the market, instead, they teach you the techniques behind those tools. Lectures are very short, with few easy examples. Most quizzes are hard to crack. You suppose to infer the answers out of the poor explanation of the concepts. In most of the lectures, the lecturer only repeats what\'s on the slides word by word not explaining much of the concepts. You don\'t have supporting materials. If you google it, it\'s hard to find the concepts covered in lectures. There are only few external references.\nThe assignments: what is hard about them is not what you have to accomplish, but instead trying to figure out the tools and topics under you have to perform. Topics like graph theory, pseudo machine code are necessary. You have to use deprecated tools that are uncommon in real life. It\'s hard to find documentation. You have to spend hours in learning those topics and tools before attempting to solve the assignments. The time slot is fair. Most of them have the expected output. Piazza is a great tool, and office hours help you a lot.\nThe exams: they are open-notes. So, it doesn\'t not matter how many times you review the lectures, or do the quizzes or the practice exams, it will not help you at all. Exams are very hard. It is expected that you master the topics that were barely covered in lectures and apply that knowledge to unrealistic situations or algorithms. The mean for the midterm was a 32/50.

The majority of the assignments mapped to the material quite nicely with the exceptions listed below. The tests were somewhat difficult but really helped solidify my understanding of the material instead of being an exercise in memorization. The TAs (and other students) were helpful on Piazza.\nMy concerns: The first assignment didn\'t align well to the material covered in the lecture. It\'s not a major issue but it wasn\'t clear what they really wanted us to get out of the material based on what was on the exam. The last two assignments were too easy and didn\'t feel like they required an understanding of the material to complete. The last lesson (dynamic-symbolic execution) didn\'t have an associated assignment which was disappointing.

He never showed up once and coming from a class last semester where the professor was heavily involved this was a let down.

Then, create a Ubuntu VM with the following: (1) JDK 1. 7. Yes this is a lot of tools and you will need them all :)\nThe assignments are for the most part pretty interesting!

Some of the students spent hours and hours on the last assignment, (Constraint Based Analysis), and the solution is surprisingly concise at about 20 lines of code.\nThe midterm and final were pretty difficult. On the midterm there was a generous curve and the instructors said that there will be a similar one for the final. The material comes from the lectures and is expanded upon. I would recommend watching each lecture twice; once before doing the corresponding homework and once before the test.

They presented the information in a pretty traditional, straightforward way (as opposed to the \"socratic\" approach of a class like ML), but they were sufficient. The quizzes embedded in the lectures were well-designed and more than just a trivial \"pick the right answer\".\nProjects - Favorite part of the class. Each project gave us a chance to use a tool in order to get hands-on experience with a topic covered in the lectures. Most of these tools required (or recommended) Linux in order to get consistent results. It would have been nice to start with a standard VM image, but it\'s also not difficult to set one up yourself. Regardless -- the projects were well-designed, relevant to the lectures, interesting, and most of all -- fun!\nExams - Both exams were open-notes. You could even use PDFs on your computer during the exam. Therefore, the questions on the exams required less rote memorization and more active application of the concepts learned. From what I\'ve heard, most of the students that had trouble with the exams actually struggled more with ProctorTrack than anything else. That\'s unfortunate, but not really a knock on the exams themselves. The questions were fair and did a good job evaluating comprehension of the material.\nAdministration - The TAs and the professor were very active and helpful on Piazza. This is not necessarily always the case in other OMSCS classes, so it was definitely appreciated here. Most of the grading was done in a timely fashion, although a few of the assignments took longer than average.\nOverall - This class is an overview class -- you\'ll cover a lot of different topics, without going too far in-depth. The class is similar to CS 6035 in that regard.

It fluctuates a lot, but I would say each assignment is 10-15 hours on average, and there were 8 assignments.\nA word of warning - this professor is absolutely obsessed with finding and punishing people who copy or reference code from other students or past classes. Multiple announcements were made throughout the semester, warning students of getting an F in the class and using heavy threats demanding \"they know who cheated, but if the student turns themselves in the punishment will be far less severe. \" The constant threats were irritating and seemed to really negatively affect student morale, especially the honest ones.

It is hard to say here who was at fault since the majority of us were able to complete the exam. There were also reports of students not downloading the diagrams ahead of time on the first 2 exams as instructed, which makes me wonder if there was not a bit of user error here. If you are in a graduate CS program and cannot figure out how to get proctoring software to work on your workstation, then you may be in the wrong field of study. It is possible that there were some technical diffuculties, but I am personally not convinced.\nAnother issue in my opinion is in regards to the weight that is placed on the part 3 of the class project. This is by far the most time consuming part of the class and is worth the same as parts 1 and 2. Based on level of effort alone, it feels like it should be worth what parts 1 and 2 were combined (i. e. double).\nOn a positive note, the lectures were pretty entertaining as the professor is somewhat of an amateur comedian.\nIn my opinion, this is good fit for those looking to obtain the Computing Systems specialization, even though my run of the course did not go off without a hitch.','Easy','Neutral','10 hours/week'),('CS-6400: Database Systems Concepts & Design','Ylm4ARjGPFaNuPJsS4odTckxzw22','My background is not in CS and I hadn\'t designed databases before I took this course.

The first two exams were essentially review for anyone who has done ER diagrams and relational modeling. The third and fourth exams were moderately difficult, with relational algebra/calculus and functional dependencies being the hardest concepts to master. Some of the exam questions regarding SQL were not everyday queries, so you did have to stop and think about what was being asked. Even though the exams were open book, not having lecture notes or some familiarity with the material would put you at a disadvantage. (Some students were \"kind\" enough to share their notes, and I\'m surprised the instructors didn\'t put the kibosh on that. )\nConcurrent with learning about the theories, we had a group project assignment. As always, the most important factor is your fellow group members. I was lucky to have a hard-working team, which made me sad that there were no peer evaluations, as I would have gladly given them all positive feedback. (One problem with group formation is that there was a \"re-org\" deadline for groups to reform after a member dropped the course, that was before the final drop deadline. So some groups had less manpower if someone dropped after the \"re-org\". ) The timeframe for each phase of the project got progressively shorter and shorter, and so the effort level had to kick up a notch or two by the end of the semester. There was also a final WebEx presentation that didn\'t quite have all the kinks worked out, but was effective.\nAll in all I enjoyed this course and I found the later material very interesting and can say I learned something new.

Many questions covered more than one knowledge item so if you missed one of the concepts you would still have the whole question wrong.\nYou need to start early studying for exams. Once the exam period starts (and I\'m not talking about the actual exam), we were not allowed to ask any questions regarding the subjects covered on the test, which I thought was an unfortunate and ill-advised rule.\nThe TAs were very helpful and questions were answered right away.

It\'s not a huge chore, but you have to build the database, find a place to host it, connect it to a server with the business logic, with a working ui on the front end that supports all of the required forms. To prove it works, you populate it with a dummy history. Simple enough, but right at the last minute, they threw up samples that had to be in with specific dates that were months in the past. If you implemented a correct database, one of the constraints is transactions can\'t take place in the past, so at the last minute you go in, remove the constraints, throw in the transactions, fix the schema and hope you didn\'t break anything so the gotchas in your demo don\'t return bad query results.\nThe kicker is the final is a few days later, covering material that bears no relation to anything else we did (indexing and physical file organization), from lectures that weren\'t available on Udacity until a few weeks prior when we were right in the heat of the project.

I regret taking it. Half of the class consists of short assignments, quizzes, and three essays which all have a hard word limit of 800 words, so you can\'t really go into depth for any of them. I felt like I didn\'t learn much through writing them because of this--I just scratched the surface of the topics. The only assignments that I feel like I benefitted from were a series of FHIR activities where we had to work with Java and perform various tasks with a FHIR database. It was a good crash corse in actually using FHIR. You could probably learn more from this course if you spend more time and did all the optional readings, but you could learn just as much independently, using google to find articles and information. I got 100% on everything so far, and I\'d be surprised if anyone didn\'t.\nThe second half of the class is a group project. You form groups or 4-6 and then can choose projects from a list provided. You rank your choices in order of preference and then you get what you get. You are allowed to think up your own project, but it is discouraged. Our group got one of our last choices, and it wasn\'t one I was even interested in, which made it very difficult to dedicate a lot of time to it. The project also ended up being quite different than we originally thought. You work with external \"mentors\" from various places like medical institutions, the CDC, etc, on the project. Many of the mentors are busy and don\'t have as much time to dedicate to the project as your group may need, so it can be difficult to get feedback from them or schedule phone calls. The group project also requires weekly status reports and quite a few powerpoint presentations, which took time to put together. I felt like this time could have been better used actually working on the project. Your grade is basically determined by how you do on the project, which highly depends on which project you end up with.','Medium','Strongly Disliked','4 hours/week'),('CS-6440: Intro to Health Informatics','google:113289203757925609230','The only redeeming quality of this class was the lectures.

If you are expecting a class where you can get caught up on weekends, this is not the course to take. It also didn\'t help for early assignments that the FHIR server used for the class would get overloaded, especially on weekends, preventing students from getting work done.\nTack on to that \"engagement\" exercises that were really more like busy work. If you like taking HR engagement surveys, there will be quite a few of them in this course. You also need to provide weekly status updates (which aren\'t too bad).

The staff acts as if this is a favor to the students to keep pushing out the dates, but it makes it extremely hard to know what\'s going on with the course. On top of that, they promise that assignments and documents will be released by certain dates and VERY consistently actually release them several days later (and often push the due dates out in response).\nThe lectures are fine. They do a pretty good job of covering the current healthcare situation in the US and different IT solutions/problems to these.

The amount of useful knowledge I feel like I gain from the lectures is minimal.\nThe project is ill-defined and we have been able to receive little useful feedback from the assigned TA. It doesn\'t help anything that the grades and feedback for each assigned deliverable is extremely late (you get feedback from the last assignment nearly by the time the next one is due) and not-at-all detailed.

Most of the more challenging work in the course has to do with the semester-long group project, which involves creating a web application that uses heatlh data records. The very start of the semester and project was somewhat disorganized, because many changes were made at the last minute to switch from the previous version of the group project to a new group project involving FHIR web services. Originally the course material stated that groups could use any web platform/framework/programming language, then after many groups formed around experience with particular technologies it was announced that all groups needed to use Java/Tomcat in order to deploy to particular machines at Georgia Tech that have access to the proprietary health data. The final deployment machines and data are not accessible to students during development, and at the end of the semester students will submit their completed WAR app which will be run on the machines with the full data for the first time without giving students the opportunity to fix any bugs or issues related to deployment and using the new data. Other than those issues (which my group avoided by requesting and being granted approval to use our own servers and data) the project is a straight-forward web application group project. Groups are required to use the health data in some way but aside from that the project is very open-ended in terms of what students can focus on for their app. As with any OMSCS group project, the previous experience of students varies greatly within the class, with some students having almost no web development experience on one end of the spectrum and some having worked in the industry for 10+ years on the other end. The groups are self-selected rather than assigned by the instructors so the overall experience level of the groups can vary as well. The instructors are active on Piazza with regular announcement posts and answers to questions from students, although sometimes basic details of assignments such as length or format of presentations are announced close to the deadline. For students with no web development or Java experience at all, I would suggest learning some basic skills before taking this course, and the CS 6300 course in the OMSCS program is the closest in terms of an intro to those sorts of development skills. Otherwise any student should be able to succeed in this course and I recommend it to anyone who has interest in the topics.','Easy','','3 hours/week'),('CS-6460: Educational Technology','pghkQQvWd5Rw3lFv8SAnKLG9x3V2','The course was good, but not great.

At the end of the course I guarantee that you\'d come out with a solid understanding of how to write academic papers and the steps involved in getting a PhD. However technologically I doubt if you will learn something.\nThe only problem that I had was that my TA was a bit ... uninterested in what I was doing. They were excellent in giving me guidance when I\'m stuck but the advice always seemed shallow. It was as if the TA wasn\'t really reading my papers/submissions in detail and giving me feedback by skimming through my content.

I won\'t re-iterate what was said in the previous reviews (its an overall good class), but I will offer some ways I think the class could improve. I think this class should have two tracks - one for people that aren\'t sure what they want to do coming in, and those that are. I feel like I did one or two too many papers, and it was a bit of a stretch sometimes trying to lead the papers towards the project I already had in my mind since the beginning of the semester. Another small thing is that a lot of people are taking OMSCS while working full time (or more). It is necessary to grade participation for peer feedback and surveys because they\'re central to the course, but grading participation in a forum (piazza) when you maybe only have an hour outside of work for free time is a bit of a downer. Some people can\'t check this stuff constantly (and when checked, most topics already have good answers). It feels like they\'re taking points away for something I can\'t help. Piazza participation will happen naturally, there\'s no need to force it on the students. Another thing is that a lot of these projects varied incredibly greatly in quality. There were some very impressive projects, and others seemed like way less than 100 hours was spent on it (particularly the research track projects). Maybe you could rework those. Some of the papers I peer reviewed were poor quality as well- maybe this was handled in the grading as a matter of course. Sometimes it was a little frustrating to put a lot of effort into my papers and then read papers that seemed like they weren\'t up to Georgia Tech\'s quality bar. Finally, the way the grading is done on the final projects for the development track encourages students to take a safe project (not a lot of effort) so that they have time to make a really polished presentation. It may discourage ambitious projects.

Some weeks only required a few hours of research and peer feedback, however other weeks required many more hours to pull an assignment together (especially the final project deliverable). Almost everything is self-paced, so be sure to have your calendar out and set reasonable milestones at the start of the project.

The grading is very generous and it\'s really easy to get grades from participation. Participation points literally rains on you from the surveys, Piazza participation, and even peer feedback (similar to KBAI). A side effect of this is that some of the peer feedback you get is pretty much generic. There are some really useful ones though so keep an eye on that.\nThe class\'s Piazza is really active and Dr. Joyner is quick to reply there and on Slack as well. Your mentor may be a hit or miss. My first mentor was great and we had lots of discussions on my research topic at the time. If you form a group, you get assigned a new mentor and that\'s usually the mentor that most group members have (if there\'s one or is random otherwise). My group\'s mentor was really hands off (as in I actually got 1 personal communication the entire time he was assigned). We didn\'t hear much from him throughout the entire project and our team\'s grades was always late.\nThe class allows you to research/work on a project that you want as long as its related to ed tech in some sense. There were some really interesting projects and I believe group work here helps a lot. While most of the time group projects are kind of a bane, this is one of the classes where it can really help you come up with something that you\'ll never be able to going at it alone. Just MAKE sure that your group mates are as interested in the idea/project as you are.

I did a research project based around another OMS class. Based on the schedule for that class, my workload varied a fair amount week to week. There were weeks where the instructional team for the other class wanted formal writeups from me that were above and beyond what this class required. I did have a bit of a crunch at the end of the semester, as I didn\'t have my full data available for analysis until about a week before the final project was due, which meant that I put in a lot of hours the last week analyzing data and writing.\nDavid Joyner describes this class as a mini Ph. D. and I think it\'s a perfect description. You explore your educational interests, propose a project, have it accepted, do the project, and defend your results. Many students picked difficult projects, put in a lot of hours, and produced amazing results. Other students put less in and got less out. I have a paper that is close to being ready for publication that I do intend to submit this summer to its intended journal. Since there\'s currently no research track available in OMS, this class was a welcome bit of research. I\'d love to see more classes like it if not a full research path available for OMS students!

You are the primary driver of what you learn. During this course there are two tracks you can take: research or development. Both require you to conduct a mini \"literature review\" before you can begin your final project. If you choose research you will either conduct your own study or find a new way to examine existing data/studies. If you choose the development track you will create a working prototype/product. There are really no lectures outside of a few at the beginning and then any others you choose to watch while trying to land on a research topic.\nThere are papers you must write during the initial research phase as you narrow down your topic. During the project phase you must do weekly check ins and two milestones. The final project is a paper formatted for journal publication, the actual project (paper or prototype), and then the actual files/research you used.\nI personally chose to do develop an actual prototype. I was given free reign to pick the platform and the features as long as I could justify them. I really enjoyed working on the project and was able to produce something I had always dreamed of producing.\nThat last point is something that the instructor specifically designed the course to encourage. During course feedback on Piazza I said at times I felt like I was paying money to work on a hobby project. He responded saying that was the idea. This course will give you credit for working on a passion project. You can then use the results for other endeavors: publishing, PhD, or even a start up.

However, there were a few things that bothered me while I was taking the course, and I wanted to wait until it was 100% over to write them up to give others a fair warning about these aspects of the course:\nFirst, the open-note final exam did not feel like a good test of the things I had learned watching the lectures and doing the assignments throughout the semester. Another reviewer mentioned it felt like \"finding a needle in a haystack\", but I wanted to expand on this further. Some of the material on the exam did not come from any of the class material. Most of the exam required finding keywords in PDFs, or a specific sentence mentioned in a lecture. Many of the questions relied on wordplay to attempt to fool the test taker (similar to the lab notebooks).\nSecond, the midterm, which I believe was indeed a fair assessment, should have included the grading rubric when it was released. A number of students wasted a lot of time on a portion of it that ultimately was worth much less than the other portions of the exam. Ultimately I believe this contributed to that assessment being the lowest grade overall for the class project-wise.\nThird, it appears reviews of the Above and Beyond portion of the assignments were mixed. You really need to attempt to do all of these if you want an \'A\' in the course. Personally, I was not really a fan. I thought that while the Above and Beyond sections could produce very excellent work, grading of the sections was too subjective. These Above and Beyond sections count for about 4% of your overall grade, and getting more than half of these points seemed almost unfeasible sometimes. I understand the intention to make the course more fun and produce original pieces of work, but I think more guidelines need to be set for both the students and the graders about what qualifies as an appropriate Above and Beyond.\nI do not mean to dissuade others from taking this class. I really did enjoy it (doing the final project and seeing others\' results was AMAZING, and all of the assignments were very well-made and fun to do). The TA\'s were extremely knowledgeable, active and helpful. And I\'ve never felt so much pride in the work I\'ve done for a class.

The auto-grader (affectionately known as \"Bonnie\") helped to provide some feedback that was useful with the coding assignment. I think this course was considered one of the easier or less-difficult courses in the past but they adapted the course this Fall term. I\'m not sure how difficult it was earlier but I personally feel this course is no joke. Some of the assignments in the middle of the semester caught me off guard and I found myself pulling all-nighters in some cases to get the project done. For me the Blending assignment, while very interesting, was the most difficult. The first two assignments were really good at getting the introductions to the material but about the 3rd project it got real, really fast. If you have some Python experience, an interest in photography, some level of Linear Algebra I would highly recommend this course. As a prerequisite recommendation, I would suggest getting accustomed to Numpy, you\'ll be using this in nearly every coding project. Also check out some OpenCV tutorials. Otherwise, enjoy computing with pictures. I rated the workload as 20 hours per week largely because of the Above and Beyond portions of the projects. This is a really good approach for a graduate level course, it allows you to dive as deep as you want on the material and there are so many cool things to explore here. I also appreciated how we had 2 weeks per project to enable getting into the material more (than having a single week for a project).

Despite their own course loads, they were present on piazza (&slack) answering questions; both technical & logistical... The only not-so-positive aspect for me personally was that a significant portion of assignment grades were deteremined by quality of report.

Having completed more rigourous courses like CSE 6220(IPC), CS6601(AI) & CS6476(CV) where the reporting was not a big factor in determing the grades found this a little discouraging.

There is an \'artsy\' component to this class, where you have to deal with taking good pictures and then talking about how you took them well in the reports. Personally, I didn\'t like the subjectivity of it. The most disheartening aspect of this course is that you must make up something to get more than 90% on any given assignment. What must you make up, you ask? That\'s a good question, as I am done with the course and still haven\'t figured it out. The final exam was open book with two attempts, however it doesn\'t test that you actually know something. It\'s more of a needle in haystack search where you have to \'select all correct choices\'. TAs were quite helpful throughout. Video lectures were pretty high level and didn\'t get into the meat of the algorithms, which made them relatively poor in my opinion. If you are doing the Computational Perception specialization, you have no choice but to take this. If you have decided on any other specialization, just take Computer Vision and you would have covered a large majority of this course, with a much greater depth of understanding of the math and algorithms as well.

Each homework assignment focused on a different computation technique or aspect of photography, and the coding/interactive portions were a blast. However, along with each assignment, we had to complete a lengthy PowerPoint report. The report templates contained many relevant questions and topics to respond to, but there were also numerous \"busy-work\" questions as well, and we had to go into great detail for each question in order to get full points.\nOn the topic of \"full points, \" the grading policy was the worst part of the course. By completing all requirements in a single homework assignment, the max possible score was a 90/100. In order to get any portion of the last 10%, we had to go \"above and beyond. \" The requirement for this was extremely subjective, so maybe this was a decent idea in theory, but it didn\'t work very well in my experience with the class. In addition to this, the grading/late policy just generally had no flexibility, and it punished all students equally, regardless of whether they were truly lazy/incompetent or just busy with another work/life issue, which is likely more common with OMSCS students compared to on-campus students. Perhaps it was fair in a way - it just seemed overly harsh to me.\nALL that being said, the course was a ton of fun, and it was a great way to brush up on Python/numpy skills. It was somewhat more time-consuming than I anticipated due to the long reports required for each assignment, but it was generally easy overall, in my opinion.\nIf you\'re at all interested in photography or image computation/manipulation, give this course a shot.

The pace was sustainable but a little tiring due to my travel plans and not being able to work ahead. Be aware of that even though the course is ranked easy (in future semester perhaps this won\'t be a problem).\nI had taken CV prior to this course, so in several areas the CP material was simpler and a less in-depth treatment of the material.

The assignments have been retooled somewhat to include more complexity, providing more of a challenge.

The final project was especially rewarding. The exam was \"check all that apply\" multiple choice, appeared deliberately vague and misleading in places, and was a mess in my opinion.\nAdministration of the class this summer was also troubling. The professor was entirely absent - he weighed in twice in Piazza and was otherwise absent, and his TAs appeared to have trouble getting guidance on simple questions that needed to be answered for assignments that had been changed (e. g. \"Can we use X function, or is it in the group that is not allowed?\"), leading to confusion and frustration on the part of students.

The assignments are a mix between structured programming assignments that implement specific algorithms covered in the lectures and non-programming assignments that involve more of a focus on photography and using software to manipulate your photos. For most of the assignments completing the assignment as specified correctly only earns a 90% score (which is the cutoff for an A grade in this course) and you are on your own to figure out some way to go \"above and beyond\" to earn the last 10%. I really liked this aspect of the course because it let me pursue my own ideas and experiment with the material from the course on my own. There is also an open-ended final project that can be done individually or as a group, and a final exam. The final exam does a good job covering all of the material from the course and is open-notes, so if you understand the material in the course you should be able to get a good score on it. The overall workload of the course is flexible, especially if you try to go above and beyond for every assignment, and in general you will be rewarded for putting a lot of effort into the course even if your end results are not amazing.\nIn terms of what you should know going into the course, general Python and numpy experience will be helpful since there is a fairly large amount of programming in the course, although for the most part the assignments mainly involve understanding how to apply the algorithms from the course rather than involving much complex code. Being familiar with the math used in the course is also very helpful (especially matrix operations which are heavily used) although the lectures do an excellent job of explaining things. Also having a high quality camera is not required, but having a camera that has manual settings for things like exposure time makes many of the photography-based significantly assignments easier (as does having a tripod for your camera). The lectures do not assume any previous knowledge about photography, digital images, or the algorithms used in the course, but those topics are covered in a lot of detail so there is a lot to learn from this course.\nOverall I would say if you are interested in photography and image manipulation and want to get some practical experience with both this is a great course.','Medium','','8 hours/week'),('CS-6475: Computational Photography','google:115350059256851896416','An easy course with simple assignments.

The heart of the class are the numerous and long projects which you need to start early. As one person put it: most classes are about the lectures and you have to fit in time to do the projects between lectures, this class is about the projects, you need to fit in some time to do the lectures between projects.\nThe lectures are very good. The projects are fun, interesting, and relevant. They are also very well set up (unlike many courses in this program). The teaching staff is helpful to some degree, but I got the best experience by watching the Spring 2018 videos by Matt Houston which the TAs shared with us. That really enhanced the class and made the projects more doable.\nThere is some criticism that the material is no longer relevant in the era of Deep Learning. I disagree completely. While DL is useful for certain CV problems, CV is much more than that. Techniques like Kallman filters, Particle Filters, and general knowledge about image processing, homographies, and hough circles are as relevant today as they were in the past. In fact, this class would be good prep for a DL class.\nThe workload for this class is quite considerable. Expect to find yourself working on these projects for 20-40 hours. Don\'t leave the project for one weekend. Its not enough.\nFinal veredict: Do this class.. the projects are great fun, you\'ll learn a lot. I highly recommend it. Of all the classes of the program, this may very well be the best one (and I\'ve taken quite a few classes so I know what I\'m talking about).\nUseful classes to take before this one: I found Computation Photography was good prep for this class.

Great material. Course management: not great but not terrible.\nOverall\nThis was my first semester in OMSCS. And my first college course in 20 or so years. I found the lectures pretty engaging overall. I had no experience with CV, no linear algebra since HS, limited experience with Python, numpy, Tensorflow, and Keras, so I learned a lot in this course. The problem sets were challenging. The specifications could have been clearer. I really struggled with the second problem set and wondered if I was cut out for the class. Then I discovered the Slack channel. Saved my life. Seeing how others approached the problem sets (and how they interpreted the sometimes vague, sometimes incorrect assignments) helped me not get too far into the weeds.\nProblem sets\nA lot of the problem sets, at the heart of it, were translating formulas (and occasional algorithm flowcharts) to Python. Sometimes I understood the fundamentals, sometimes it was straight up transcription.\nCourse Management & Piazza\nPiazza was pretty much a dumpster fire. Hard to believe anyone would choose it as a tool. TAs were occasionally helpful, often terse. Lots of questions went unanswered. Trying to navigate Piazza made it not worth trying to get help. Prof. Essa was in absentia until the very end when people got upset. He was also disingenuous by suggesting he told TAs not to reply so students would help each other out. I\'d have believed that if it wasn\'t offered as a post-hoc excuse.\nFinal project\nThe final project (I chose the CNN one) was very challenging. I learned a crap ton, even though my results were pretty much worthless. I thought I might have tanked it but ended up getting 100%. Probably because I documented it well in the paper. And because I did a lot of research up front and tried to base my approach on current research.\nExam\nExam was challenging but not terrible. Open book. Which was helpful. I spent a good half-day reviewing the lecture transcripts (helpfully put together by a fellow Slacker) and the lecture slides. Lots of ctrl-f of course. Managed to eke out a B on the final and a high B for the course. That included slacking for a week of vacation and getting a 61% on one of the problem sets.\nAdvice\nMake sure your linear algebra and calculus fundamentals are strong. It will help you truly understand the material.\nMake sure you have a pretty solid basis for numpy, especially how slicing and reshaping and such works. Lean on numpy vs. for loops.\nSpend a few hours at the start of the course getting a high level view of the history and current topics in CV.\nnote: my workload is based on actual measurements.

Dont expect to learn anything state of the art. However, some concepts are important IMO.\nThe worst part about this course is the professor. Prof. Irfan Essa, is one of the rudest professors I have seen in academics. His presence in the class is negligible; the course would be better off if it was none.

Personally I like this aspect more.

And Be patient.\nRegarding the comment below that \"He openly stated he told TAs not to help students with questions\", I think the professor means(and he did say) that he encourages discussions instead of feeding you answers directly. My observation is that if I ask \"will I be punished if I use this function in my assignment\", TA will answer it very fast. But if I ask \"is algorithm A/parameter A better than algorithm B/parameter B for this assignment/project\", usually I will not get an answer from the TAs directly (but usually this issue has been discussed somewhere else in the post). I understand it might be a pain if you are rushing to a deadline but I think it\'s fair for effective learning. I learnt a lot by discussing problems with other classmates. But of course it would be better if TA/professor can give some conclusion remarks on some of the discussions.\nOverall after taking the course I respect computer vision more as a science.

The material is really dense and it covers a lot of relevant topics. You could spend upwards of 6+ hours every week to really grasp the weekly lectures. There are 6 bi-weekly projects which can easily eat up your time. So you may end up paying more attention to the lectures related to the project and skim the rest. The project implementation goes hand in hand with the lectures. Everything you need are in those wonderful Bobick lectures. Aaron Bobick\'s lectures are great. He keeps the topics engaging and breaks it down into understandable segments. The project topics covered a range from basics of image processing, hough transforms, homography, motion tracking, optical flow, classification, detection,etc.. One topic that was genuinely missing was deep learning methods like CNN, R-CNN (supervised learning SVM is part of the course).\nYou have 5 choices for your final project.

It would have made a lot of difference if the prof and/or TAs could use office hours to augment the video content with current day relevance, or expand on difficult topics etc. Because of lack of their involvement, the experience was not very different from watching yet another MOOC video.\nAssignments - There were 6 - barring a couple, most very fairly hard.

The six projects had two week windows (plus a 3 week final project) and typically required tremendous effort, an average of 40 to 50 hours, and a peak of 70 hours for me. They mostly started off pretty cool - the coding was fun, the outputs were impressive - but typically had was too many parts, such that by the end the joy was sucked out of them. PS2 about sign detection was particularly atrocious in this regard. It just had way too much packed in. A notable exception was PS3 on augmented reality, which had a more reasonable workload (~30 hours), which allowed it to be strictly fun. It\'s my understanding that they redid a bunch of the projects this semester and it sounds like they got harder. This also meant there were frequent bugs in provided code, though I\'d imagine this will be less of an issue going forward if they keep the same projects. In my opinion this course would be better off either split into two courses or with a little less depth; I was just so fatigued by the end that I really didn\'t enjoy it, even though the content is fascinating.\nI am surprised by the recent review which commends the instructional staff - this course has objectively the worst instructor interaction of any of six courses I\'ve taken thus far.

The ratio of instructor responses to student responses is 0.642 - I\'ve rarely (never?) had a class below 1.0. There were commonly bugs in project code that would be caught by students, and the instructors would not post updates or even make conspicuous announcements about the errors to save hours of pointless frustration for students on already tremendous projects. The one glaring exception to this trend were TA Matt Houston\'s office hours, which were excellent.

Even the seemingly small detail of having a black background was well thought out, and make the videos not too straining to the eye. The problem sets are hard and you need to get on them as soon as possible. Beware of the first major assignment (Road sign detection) because it is deceivingly difficult, and the video tracking assignment which was super difficult as well.

Very rewarding, but very time-consuming.\nThere is a huge amount of material covered. It helps that Dr.Bobick\'s videos are not only incredibly well laid out and clear, but also quite enjoyable to watch. They\'re also very thorough, so as long as you can fit enough time to dedicate to lectures (4-6 hours a week) you\'ll learn quite a bit within each topic.

Previous offerings of the class seem to have had additional assignments, but starting this term we had a final project instead of the last (2?) assignment(s). The final project had a few selection options, to further explore more advanced and state-of-the-art algorithms for methods we used in assignments and/or other material presented in class that we didn\'t work on in assignments, and we were given 3 weeks to complete it. Many people thought there were too many things required to be completed for the projects, particularly the convolutional neural network project, so it could easily take 70+ hours to complete everything. A lot of the time spent on assignments and even on the final project is parameter tweaking. Be prepared to have fairly well designed algorithms in place, but spend loads of time tweaking parameter values to achieve optimal results.\nThe final exam was open-book and the study guide was very representative of what you needed to know for it. It was a fair exam. As long as you can review most, if not all, of the material beforehand, and find answers to all of the practice questions in the study guide, the exam is not difficult at all. Questions tended to be pretty base-level, focusing mainly on overall concepts and important algorithm details discussed in class.\nTAs were for the most part responsive, but as others have noted, Matthew Houston\'s office hours were a huge asset in completing the assignments. The forums were very helpful for finding out where to go when you were stuck and/or for discussing the assignments.\nI highly recommend this class, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to it.

If you have some time, you could try and familiarize yourself with openCV 2.4 as well, as you\'ll be using this package a lot in the class.

Mind blowing feeling to go from knowing nothing, to knowing, uh.. something (Prof. Bobick style joke), and as an added bonus you will develop an internal clock that always knows AoE time. What makes the course hard? The sheer volume of videos to watch and assignments to complete in a short 17 weeks.

That 50 is not from leaving the timer running by mistake - it\'s the time I packed in attempting to do the final project which I found incredibly difficult. The week before that with only 14 hours was the one I spent flailing around, despairing of being able to do the final project. Advice for others 1. Don\'t fall behind on watching the lectures! Watch them all before doing the assignments - even without taking notes and/or at 2x speed. They might seem to not be connected to the assignments, but they open up your mind to things that will help you do the assignmets - and certainly will make a big difference preparing for the exam. 2. Start assignments the minute the day they are released. Don\'t procrastinate because usually success in the assignments (especially if you\'re a newbie) is more a function of time than anything else. 3. Make an effort to post questions to the Office Hours, or be familiar with the assignment so you can benefit more from them - Mathew Houston\'s recorded OH were extremely helpful. 4. In the assignments, strive for 100% because the final project is 5 times harder than any assignment and you have only 3 weeks to complete it (took me about 85 hours to turn in something not so great), so it\'s likely to bring your grade down. Some criticism: The assignments have a lot of starter code written for you, so you can learn Python and OpenCV as you go along, however, it would have helped if the Matlab quizzes in the lectures were replaced with OpenCV ones (but Pedro the TA did provide OpenCV versions for some of them).

The assignments are So. Hard. I have a degree in computer science and 4 semesters of calculus, but still could not decipher the mathematical formulas we were given to implement our code. I easily spent 40+ hours a week, 20+ hours spent trying to decipher the assignment. Some people claimed they finished assignments (even the final!) in 3 days - I spent every spare minute on my computer from the minute assignments were released to the hour the assignment was due, and I was still lucky to get a B. The course is great, really. I loved watching the videos, and you learn some fantastic state-of-the-art stuff, like sensing road signs for self-driving cars, to how to create special effects like you see in the movies. The difficulty comes from being asked to implement these things using just the math. You\'ve introduced to the topic, the theory explained, the math given and explained, and then off you go! The problem is that none of that gives you an algorithm to implement. I found it incredibly frustrating to interpret the math, and in the end had to conclude half of it was nonsense, unless that large \'E\' symbol means something other than sum, and every time they ask you to subtract the mean (average), they are just kidding.\nIn the end the only reason I passed was because I ignored the formulas, looked at code off the internet, and got the source code for the openCV functions we weren\'t allowed to use, and painstakingly over several days, went line-by-line through the dense C++ code, figured out what it was doing, where it matched with the formula we were given, where it didn\'t, and rewriting everything into python.\nIf you don\'t have a lot of time, don\'t take this course. You cannot skip a lecture, and will probably end up watching all of them several times, rewinding to go over some dense explanation. If, however, you do have the time, want to learn some amazing skills, and can decipher mathematical equations with ease, you will love this course.','Very Hard','Liked','40 hours/week'),('CS-6476: Computer Vision','GNpsXRgoRDXVihcZVkbgwLTBaxv2','This was an excellent class; very interesting lectures and course material. Dr. Bobick\'s lectures are fun to watch and he does a good job of explaining the topics. There were about 30 hours of lectures which seems like more than some of the other classes in the program. It\'s important to watch them before working on assignments since the implementation steps for some of the problem sets are directly given in the lectures. The TAs were great at releasing the problem sets and grades on a regular 2 week schedule. Matthew Houston also gave well prepared office hours that he recorded weekly which were very helpful. The final project had 5 possible topics and requires a lot of work; my advice is to limit your scope initially because you may otherwise try something too ambitious and not be as pleased with your results. The open note final was pretty straightforward. Taking CP first was very helpful for me since I hadn\'t touched python in a decade and I wrote more code for the traffic sign detection problem set than I did in all of CP (including my final project). The overlap in some of the topics with CP also helped me feel more comfortable in completing the CV problem sets.

It focuses on \"classic\" (pre-deep learning) computer vision, though there is a final project option that uses KNNs. The lectures are countless (after I completed the first one, I thought I was done for the week, but then I looked at the syllabus and realized it was only one out of five for the first week) and dense, so you get a thorough understanding how each presented method works. Not much fluff or handwaving going on here, Prof. Bobick will explain the algorithms and the math involved in detail.\nThe problem sets are challenging and time consuming, but also well-designed and motivating. At the end of each of them you\'ll have something quite impressive to show to your friends or co-workers. About half the problem set points are awarded by the autograder, and the other half comes from the report which mostly consists of images and/or video generated by your code. So if you get all the points from the autograder, you\'re almost guaranteed to get an A. So the outcome of the course is quite binary: either you don\'t \"get\" the material or your coding skills are insufficient and you drop half-way through, or you\'re able to complete the problem sets and get an A or B (the exam being the wildcard). Speaking of the exam, it was open-everything and unproctored, but still quite challenging. The assignments are only released one at a time, so front-loading is not really possible. On the plus side, everyone is working on the same stuff, so the collaboration (on Piazza) is better.\nIn terms of pre-reqs, make sure to brush up on Linear Algebra (you should at least know what a system of linear equations is, for example). A little bit of Computer Graphics knowledge is also helpful, but not required. I did Pryby\'s \"Linear Algebra Refresher\" on Udacity in advance, which taught me Python and Linear Algebra at the same time (without numpy, which I picked up during the course).\nIf you have a full-time job, I would definitely recommend not taking a second course with this one (unless maybe if you\'re a numpy master who does singular value decomposition in his head for fun).','Hard','Loved!','25 hours/week'),('CS-6476: Computer Vision','qnAaiyrvyBN3lH75njavIsxcwOI3','This class was intense and difficult, but it was also a lot of fun.

Thankfully, the problem sets supplemented the material quite well, and helped me to understand some of the math and concepts that were discussed in the lectures. Even so, without a fantastic TA (Pedro) who hosted office hours every week to talk about issues in the problem set, this class would have absorbed much more time. To get over a 95% on the problem sets, you had to put in some work to show going “above and beyond” what was assigned. Typically, this took the form of an additional “challenge problem” in the assignment. These problems usually were parameter-tuning extensions of the original assignment, but could take several hours to complete. I should also note that several assignments required some amount of parameter tuning, which some find tedious and boring. While this may be true, it does accurately reflect the nature of the field.\nOverall, this was an enjoyable class to take.

The TAs are very knowledgeable and helpful, made good comments when assignments were returned.\nRegarding the content of the course, much of your time will be spent on parameter tuning rather than implementing concepts and algorithm (especially in problem set 2, the hardest one IMO). So it is a good idea to play with the parameters early in the course and get an understanding of how they change the results.

Most of the comments already here describe the experience well, so I\'ll concentrate on advice. 1) Study the prereqs specified for the course, but don\'t expect for a moment that will get you by. Read the assigned textbook for the course (Sipser) and try, try, try to understand it before you attempt the course (yes, all of it). If you don\'t, you will not likely do well in this course. Use the Internet to help your understanding of the material (watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation video series). 2) The teaching/videos in the class are terrible. Sadly, most of the stuff I found on the Internet presents the material in the exact same way. Your best bet? Find a group to work with to help you try and understand the material. And really try to understand it, because you will need to turn in homework that is based on your own thoughts. Additionally, your group will not be there to help you on the exams. 3) Your grade is based on you and you alone. You will not get a good grade just because you did better than a certain percentage of the class. If that what you need to succeed, this class is not for you. 4) Don\'t expect to ever know how you truly stand in the class. Grading (under the current grading style) is very vague and inconsistent. If the thought of this drives you crazy, stay far away. 5) If you feel you are doing poorly in 1st half of the class, don\'t assume you will do better in the 2nd half. It is possible that you will. It is likely that you won\'t.

I learned a lot about LaTeX.\nThis is a math course. It\'s probably better off without the python. But you also probably don\'t know enough about writing in Math yet, so this is really difficult. From set theory and countability of infinite sets to graph theory and vertex covers and maximum matchings. There is a lot of math.

The professor really wanted to clamp the students down to his style of learning. In a way, I enjoyed the \"isolation\" method that was suppose to bring about ones own ability to solve a problem. I think to some extent it worked. I felt like I was really using my brain, and I felt I was generally sharper in my daily life. These were the homework assignments. They were difficult, but we were given another chance to submit after they had been graded. I didn\'t do too bad on these, but honestly I spent too much time on them. I should have been focusing on the concepts as a whole which would have helped me on the tests which I never did too hot on. I spent forever on the HW assignment, and I never had time to do the challenge problems.

Also new this semester: the course is now divided in three sections, for each one of them there\'s a proctored exam (closed book, one sheet of notes - two sided). So it was easier to study than for previous terms, when there were two exams.\nThe exam problems were very similar to the problem sets given for each unit. There were no \"official\" solutions for the ungraded problem sets, the philosophy of the instructor is that we should work on them on our own (but collaboration in study groups was encouraged - I know there were study groups on G+ Hangouts, Slack, and locally held meetings). Working on study groups really helped. An informal statistic for a group had: 11 A\'s, 10 B\'s, 6 C\'s.

I spent at least 30 hours a week on homework, and I have a CS/Math background. Some things I\'d recommend before beginning the class:\nGet familiar with mathematical notation. I spent lots of time early on just trying to figure out how to read and understand the assignments, let alone work through solutions.\nFamiliarize yourself with basic proof methods (induction, direct, contradiction). Luckily I had an old discrete math book from undergrad lying around that was very helpful in the beginning weeks of the course. It\'s also worth skimming over general topics in discrete math (and probably some from graph theory as well).\nI can\'t emphasize enough how little free time I had during this class. I had time to go to work, come back home and study/do homework for 3-4 hours, and then go to bed. I also spent most weekends working on homework. 16 weeks of this is draining--I can\'t imagine doing this with a family and/or other obligations. However, the work I put in definitely paid off. I was able to get over 100% as my homework average, which balanced out a mediocre performance on the final. I ended up with an A (barely).\nLectures: The lectures for this class were very hit and miss for me. I really enjoyed the first half of the class, and thought the lectures did a better job of thoroughly explaining the concepts. The second half of the class was less enjoyable for me. The lectures seemed to assume a very strong background in linear algebra and didn\'t work through examples at some crucial points (thinking specifically of the linear programming lectures). I took linear algebra in undergrad and so that part wasn\'t so bad, but the lack of examples on things like the Simplex method really made things difficult. Don\'t try to breeze through the lectures. When watching, I would rewind a portion 3 or 4 times with pencil and paper in front of me. If I didn\'t understand a concept, I\'d rewatch until I could write it out in my own words. This helped in the long run, but was excruciatingly slow. There were several times, especially during the second half of the semester, that consulting Google for lecture notes from other programs was beneficial. If you do this, make sure you cite your source if you\'re working on homework.\nHomework: For me, the homework in this class was the most valuable part of the class. Dr. Pryby\'s assignments were extremely difficult (hours and hours of work), but they forced you to understand the concepts in the lectures, and stretched you to think deeply about the topics. The feeling you get when you figure out that key piece of insight is amazing. This is where you should really focus your efforts. It is possible to get > 100 as your homework average if you work hard enough, and this can help pick up crucial slack for the midterm and final. The only real complaint I have about the homework is that sometimes the solutions were not presented very well. I\'d prefer to see solutions in as dumbed-down terms as possible so that the class can easily follow how a particular solution was derived. Go to as many office hours as you can--occasionally I didn\'t think I needed any help on a homework, but joined anyway and the TA would basically give you the answer, or give you an insight that made you change your answer for the better.\nIf there\'s one thing to take away from this review, it\'s to start the homework early. Being able to grind away at a proof over the course of 2 or 3 days is just not something you can pack into an hours long window (unless you\'re a math whiz). Give yourself enough time to really think about the problems. Write an answer out, then come back to it a few days later and see if it makes sense.\nTests: The tests were extremely stressful. Unless you\'re a genius, you probably aren\'t going to finish all of the problems. You have 3 hours to complete 8 to 10 problems, some of which are formal proofs. That gives you 18 to 22 minutes on each problem. One strategy I adopted was to go through the entire test and work on problems that I immediately had insight on. It\'s not worth spending 30 minutes on a problem you just don\'t get, and then missing a problem that you might have been able to quickly grasp. The reality for me was that in a timed situation, I was either going to immediately have some insight into the problem, or I wasn\'t (and if I didn\'t get it immediately, spending 10-20 minutes on it was not likely to help). I felt absolutely terrible after both tests, but the average turned out to be in the 40s or 50s for each one, so as long as you meet or exceed the average, you should be fine. Another tip--the graders want to give you points. Write down anything, even if you know it\'s not totally right or if it seems silly. You never know--you might end up getting a fraction of a point. And for this class, every little bit helps.\nPart of the stress for me with the tests was the ProctorTrack system that was used. I was terrified that my internet connection would drop, someone would come in the room, or some other infraction would occur and I\'d fail.\nGrading/Administration: This is only my second class, but the TAs all were very helpful, I thought. They were empathetic with students and were encouraging during office hours. They held frequent office hours and had \"watch together\" sessions. They were also very available on Piazza (at least compared to the other class I\'ve taken). Dr. Pryby was also fairly active on Piazza. One feedback that I think most students had was that the office hours should be recorded. There was some pushback from the instructors on this, but maybe they\'ll change it in future semesters.\nAs for the grading--for a class involving writing proofs, I thought the grading was quite fair. If you think about it, any error in a proof makes the entire proof totally invalid. From this perspective, getting partial credit is generous. Show all of your work, and if you\'re not sure if you should include or explain something--just go ahead and do so. This should go without saying, but participate in as much extra credit as you possibly can. You need every point you can muster.\nBooks: Just go ahead and get both of them. At some points during the semester, I needed a combination of book + videos to understand the concepts. In many cases, the books were much clearer than the lectures. CLRS is probably worth having on your bookshelf anyway.\nConclusion: This was a very rewarding class. I feel like the my knowledge of the foundations of computing is now very solid.

I did some theoretical computer science research during my undergraduate study. Therefore I am quite familiar with the all the course materials yet still it\'s very challenging for me.\nThe first half of the course was about Turing Machine, Decidable, Recognisable and NP-complete, NP-hard. It requires very strong math proving skills. It\'s ok if you don\'t understand these concepts prior to the class. Nevertheless, you should be comfortable with reading the proof and checking if one proof is correct or not and writing proofs you know for sure is correct. If you don\'t know whether you can do these, try to prove quick-sort is O(n^2) in the worst case and is O(nlogn) in expectation. Try to prove that fibonacci series equation F_n = (a^n-(-a)^(-n))/sqrt(5), where a = (1+sqrt(5))/2 by mathematical induction. Also the HW0 is somewhat similar to these problems. If you are not comfortable with HW0, drop the course immediately.\nThorough out the first half of the course, you should find that most proving problems follow a pattern. For example, how to prove something is undecidable, you reduce it to HALT. how to prove something is decidable, you find a decider. How to prove something is NP-Complete, you first prove it\'s in NP by providing a verifier verifies the instance in polynomial time and second you reduce the problem to some known NP-Complete problem. As long as you follow the proving patterns, you are in the right direction. Google for solutions of the homework also helps but make sure you understand it and then close the webpage and write your own proof and cite the website in the homework.\nThe second half of the course focuses on solvable problems and polynomial time algorithms. While implementing the algorithm is mandatory in the homework, it still places most of the attention on proving the algorithm is correct and analysing the time complexity. Some basic graph concepts and algorithms like bfs, dfs and shortest path will help. Learning these algorithms doesn\'t mean you can implement the algorithm. Instead, it means you know how to prove the correctness of the algortihm (like what I said, you know for sure your proof is valid) and you know how to analysis the time complexity.\nThe homework is hard but try doing all homework including the bonus as much as possible. I particularly enjoy the moment when I solve the problem after 3 hours intensive thinking. Also, I personally think it\'s better to handwrite all the homework so that writing proof for middle exam and final exam won\'t be uncomfortable. I don\'t have much suggestions for the exams. Try doing your best.\nHope you all doing well on this course.','Very Hard','','20 hours/week'),('CS-6505: Computability, Complexity & Algorithms','google:111761682530459729572','Unlike some, I do not have a very favorable opinion of this class. I did learn quite a bit. But the bottom-line; the amount of time used was excessive compared to the value of the knowledge gained. So, a highly inefficient learning experience overall. I have a strong CS background. As an undergraduate, I received a 3. 97 GPA for my computer science work and have received an A in every other class in the OMSCS program that I have taken for a grade except for this one. In this class, I received a B. In fact, only 16% of the students in this class received an A, and as can be seen by looking at Course Critique (https://critique. gatech. edu/course. php?id=CS6505), the grade distribution with the current instructor is skewed in a direction generally unfavorable to students. So beware, if you choose to take this course, you are in for a huge amount of work and perhaps a significant amount of stress. In my opinion, it would be perfectly reasonable to choose your specialization such that you could avoid this class. Alas, at the moment that would mean that you specialize in Interactive Intelligence, although there might be other ways to dodge this class while specializing in Robotics or Machine Learning in the future if they expand their algorithms offerings. Anyway, in my opinion, this class isn\'t going to give you any deep insights about the world; but it will seriously mess up your schedule for the semester. It is a perfectly reasonable choice to choose your specialization specifically so you can avoid this class.\nThe current instructor, Chris Pryby, has a Ph. D. in mathematics, not in computer science. Not surprisingly, this class has a certain bias towards mathematics. I would say that the way that the class was administered in Fall of 2015 that it is about 80% math and only 20% computer science. Of course, if the instructor were to change, it is perfectly possible for this bias to change as well. To make the point: if you were to choose your undergraduate major based on your desire to complete this class, I would recommend that you major in math rather than computer science. Alas, since most of you have probably finished undergrad, this is a useless point as a practical matter but very important in terms of how you should prepare yourself for success in this class. What is important in this class is not so much your ability to implement any algorithm or concept, but instead to produce mathematical proofs that relate to them.\nAs a side note. The mathematics in this class is not particularly hard. I had a colleague at work who was a mathematics major before receiving his Ph. D. in bioinformatics assert that the level of mathematics in this course appeared to be at about an undergraduate level when he saw what I was doing as far as the homework. It is not the formal level of mathematics in this class that makes the course hard, it is the way that this mathematics is taught (or more accurately, really not taught in the class) that makes the course hard. Basically, for this class, you either know the mathematics (including proof techniques) already or you are going to have to teach yourself. I would personally put this up as one of my pet peeves about the course. (And full disclosure, I have several such pet peeves). The lectures are sort of computer science oriented and sometimes even interesting when Lance Fortnow was in the picture. But the homework is really all math. And the math in the homework is not anything that is covered in the lectures. So, if you are someone who likes to learn from lecture like I do, you will be at a disadvantage, because you are going to have to teach yourself any undergraduate-level math concepts you are missing from the Internet or from a textbook or whatever on your own. And you had better hope, based on previous experience, that how you setup the problem is sensible, because there will not be any feedback in terms of lecture about how to solve problems UNLESS you try to find a lecture recorded for some other class that covers the same topic, which can be a hit or miss endeavor. Anyway, as a practical matter for those reading this review, here is my advice. Don\'t watch the lecture and expect it to help you with the homework, the midterm, or the final all that much. Indeed, there is only a limited relationship between the lecture and the things that determine your grade. Instead of focusing too much on the lecture, I would recommend that you focus on the homework problems and consider the lecture but one resource that MIGHT sometimes be useful in figuring out how to solve the cs-themed math problems that are the bread and butter of this course. As often or not, an outside resource will be more valuable to you than the actual lecture. Do not be surprised by this. For example, at the beginning of the class, I would highly recommend a strong focus on the \"optional\" Sipser textbook in particular. (Oh, and don\'t be fooled by the syllabus. There is nothing \"optional\" about the recommended textbooks UNLESS you already own a textbook that is substantial similar. ) In fact, if you are taking CS 6505, why are you even reading this review? You should be reading Sipser.\nA note about office hours. In the Fall of 2015, there were two types of office hours. Office hours where lecture was watched together and office hours that covered the homework. As I was taking two classes, I personally did not have time to show up to many \"watch together\" type office hours. But the few I did go to were not all that useful. But don\'t get confused. If you find the \"watch together\" office hours less than useful, don\'t make the mistake of assuming (like I did early on), that the office hours are a waste of time. In fact, the office hours that go over the homework are pretty much must watch for most people. Indeed, if I were to take the class over again, the first thing I would do when I received the homework is review it and try to complete as much of it as possible before office hours covering that homework is held. Then you will be well-positioned to maximally benefit from office hours and just maybe, have something resembling a normal life. As others have mentioned, it is in office hours that many of the \"hints\" to the \"tricks\" that will otherwise end up consuming your entire life are given. Thus, being properly prepared for office hours is often the only efficient means of solving the homework and the way to steal back some free time from this time-sucking course. So, do not make the mistake I did, which is to insist on watching the lectures before attempting the homework. The lectures (which still are not optional) probably will not help you that much with the homework anyway. Just as often, it will be some third-party source of information that is key. I would also argue if you are a visual learner who likes to learn from seeing others work out problems, that Chris Pryby\'s office hours should not be skipped, since he has a tablet and works out problems. Other TAs often resort to typing out math in chat, which, in my opinion, barely works and is highly inefficient even when it does work. Oh, and if your schedule doesn\'t allow you to make it to office hours one week? At least in the Fall of 2015, too bad. Office hours are not recorded like they should be in order to give everyone the same access to the same information. People who have time in their schedule for office hours will have an information advantage over those who do not. (And this is especially critical, because while the lectures often aren\'t that helpful to solving the homework, midterm, or final, the office hours do cover that sort of information. )\nAnother point. The title of the course Computation, Complexity, and Algorithms. Low and behold, other courses offered at Georgia Tech, but not yet to OMSCS students include Computational Complexity Theory, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms, and Randomized Algorithms. CCA includes all of these topics, albeit on a sort of superficial level. You would think that since all of these topics are covered, that the course would focus heavily on the interrelationships between them. But despite some noises in the lectures about such interconnections, that is far from the focus in the class. No or little knowledge of interconnections between these topics will help you in the homework, midterm, or final. Anyway, my experience in this class was essentially this. At just about the time I start feeling comfortable, maybe even competent, dealing with one area, it is time to move on to the next. So, don\'t expect to acquire an especially strong foundation or confidence in any of the topics above as a reward for taking this class (although you should have a reasonable introduction). Maybe the exception is computation, but for that, I would credit the excellent Sipser book, much more than this class. Also, the earlier lectures are much better than later lectures.\nAnyway, I am nearly done with my rant. As you might infer from the tone, I did not much like this class. My view is that it is too much work for too little return. Something to be endured, not enjoyed. If CCA were a stock, I would sell it short. But that said, if you take this class, you will learn a lot. It is just that you will have to put in a disproportionate amount of work in learning it. (I feel I would have benefitted more from self-study, where I would control the agenda. ) In terms of grading, you can expect low scores that are then generously curved. But in the end, as a practical matter, much of the class is nearly as much of a test of pre-existing knowledge and mathematical skills as anything else, especially when it comes to setting up problems or figuring out the cute \"tricks\" necessary to get to the end. (And it shouldn\'t have to be said, but knowing how to setup the problem is probably 50% of the challenge. So focus on that first. ) And while I have seen classes that grade on a curve being well-done, in this case, I believe the curve disguises the fact that the course designers do not have a particularly clear agenda regarding what skills and knowledge they actually expect students to acquire from the class. It is more of, lets test them on a bunch of stuff and see what sticks sort of thing. A curve can (in theory) be the most fair way to grade students; but it can also be a way of concealing flawed course design. In this particular case and for this particular class, I believe it is the latter not the former.\nNow, there is a particular sort of person that enjoys this class. And without exception, I believe that what sets those people apart is that they are very well-prepared in terms of mathematics and perhaps in terms of schedule (probably they are only taking one course). As I have said, neither the mathematics nor the insights in the course are all that hard, in retrospect. But what is hard is the amount of material you are expected to cover with inadequate time to cover it systematically and thoroughly due to the lack of a focused and clear learning agenda. For those who come into the course with very solid skills (such that they probably do not even need to take the course, really), then it is a pretty fun problem-solving experience. Maybe it even hits the sweet spot for optimal learning. For everyone else who is going to take this course, I do not believe that you will find this course to be anywhere close to enjoyable or a great use of your time relative to the reward. I certainly did not enjoy the class or feel that it is was a good use of my time. But then again, I am not a math major. Perhaps if I had been one, I would have enjoyed this course too.','Hard','','30 hours/week'),('CS-6505: Computability, Complexity & Algorithms','google:105958129498784865425','Prerequisite to succeed in this class are discrete math, mathematical proofs, automata, languages, basic knowledge of algorithms, data structures, linear algebra, set theory, and graph theory.\nIn some cases, it will be easier to read either the Sipser book, CLRS book, or look up other resources for the material.\nThe lectures and homework were created by an old professor.

Remember the old adage - no pain, no gain! This course is very helpful in many ways, one of which is that the concepts covered here are used in pretty much every other course (and I\'ve taken 2 others so far). At the end of the day, computer science is a lot about math - not just programming, and understanding the principles behind the programs we write is just as important. I was just as frustrated when taking the course - the countless times I\'ve complained, the near nervous breakdowns and the constant frustration of not being able to solve the assignment problems on my own.

A few things to succeed in this course\nBe prepared - take some preparatory courses if this is the first time you are taking such a course.

I didn\'t get to fully process each assignment because it was due within two weeks, and then another (really big) assignment was assigned right away. The midterm and final were used to \'teach\' us concepts that the assignments and lectures didn\'t go into any depth on. Having more time would allow for interesting programming assignments on topics such as neural nets, constraint satisfaction problems, etc. It would also allow for the midterm and final to focus on topics that have been fully taught. I have no idea the mechanics of splitting a course up, but I hope the idea is considered for the sake of future students.\n2) The midterm and final were rough. They were long (each took me 15-20 hours and I could have spent longer) and each one had some topics that were literally just a mention in the lectures. The student had to research and learn on their own how to solve problems and use certain equations. In addition, the questions themselves were not well vetted. Most questions required multiple clarifications during exam week, which required that you go back and redo questions you thought were done (to make sure your interpretation matched the clarification). The exam questions were excellent for homework problems, but on a high-stakes exam it was not a good experience.\n3) The curve is generous, so if your grade is low you still have hope of at least a B. Don\'t be intimidated by the 100% median on assignments.\n4) You get to drop one of the six assignments. This is critical considering how fast the class moves.\n5) Do NOT take as a first course. I recommend it be the middle or end of your course progression. I took it halfway through after ML4T, which was great because the Python/numpy came in very handy.\n6) Carve out time for this class. I do not recommend pairing it with another course, and find ways to set aside at least 20 hours a week.\n7) As far as prep, reviewing Bayes/basic probability and having solid Python skills will help.\nOverall I learned SO much from this class.

It is written up as a survey class in AI but I\'d say some of the work is probably harder than alot of specialized classes in specific subjects similar. I went in knowing little about AI and came out knowing a bunch of algorithms but not to much on how to put it all together.\nThe videos: well done and think it was smart to use others lectures when appropriate to explain concepts. Sometimes someone else explained it quite good, why reinvent the wheel and like this design in the lectures. However, especially when Thad was teaching, there were somewhat of a very light explanation of really complicated subject matter not well explained. Thad is clearly very intelligent and sometimes takes for granted the intelligence or former knowledge of his audience.\nThe book: You are expected to read this whole gargantuan book. It is dense and really really hard to follow. The algorithms given in book are in most cases better explained elsewhere, for example in the authors own videos. I learned multiple concepts better by watching videos elsewhere then I ever did this book. My eyes glazed over when I looked at it many times and found watching youtube videos on concepts way more productive.\nThe projects: Time consuming and difficult. All the projects came with unit test which many times did a horrible job of actually testing your code. This also led you in a false sense of security especially when Bonnie submissions were limited. Bonnie submissions on some projects were unlimited but limited on others. Also, the feedback from Bonnie was usually unhelpful. Many times you were being forced to write a complicated algorithm from scratch even though the algorithm existed elsewhere. You would write it and it would seem to work with the crappy unit test you had. However, Bonnie wouldn\'t like it and you would be stuck with WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG HERE? You would spin your wheels for hours and hours trying to find a bug with no idea what was wrong. Again, you are implementing an algorithm you didn\'t write and purely in math form that was really complicated. If your are unfamiliar with the math symbols, etc, it could get you. And so you would have 8 lines of code where there was a bug but sometimes you just couldn\'t figure it out. Now here is the other problem. For some reason there were a number of people who did really well on the projects. So, he grades based on median being an A and 1 stddev being a B. However, the median would most times end up being a 100%. So, good luck with that. Note, the median is done at the end of class so the test bring down the medians to a nicer range, but it can be quite frustrating to learn that your 95% or 90% on a project is a B. Dropping the last one is also done in the median calculation so it actually makes the standard deviation get smaller.\nThe test: Ridiculous. You are given a week and are take home. They are so much calculation and so easy to make a simple calculation error. The midterm took me around 40 hours and the final around 60 hours. I took three days off work for the final otherwise I wouldn\'t have been able to complete. It is really dumb too, cause it doesn\'t test ones ability to understand the concept but rather one\'s ability to do the math by hand. I ended up purchasing a scientific calculator as you have to have it to do the math. The other dumb thing is the test is open book but the internet is off limits. This means you can\'t use easier to follow explanations of an algorithm on spots like Wikipedia you had to use the confusing books explanations. This is another reason you had to use a calculator alot to do things like log10(x**(y/t)). And you would lose half credit for rounding incorrectly to the 6 decimal point. Test became about doing complicated calculations rather than understanding concepts and I found to be the most useless part of this class. Note, I got B\'s on the midterm and final median was 78.65% and 67.8%.\nThe TAs: Overall pretty helpful but many times refused to help on certain things I believe as ordered by the Prof. Also, no help during test and had a now work on weekend policy which was super annoying since everything was due on Sunday. Never seen that rule before.\nOverall, the class is educational but don\'t think I could carry it into a good understanding of how to use AI in the world. I wish there was less focus on the math and more on the ideas which is what I thought a survey class would do. Maybe I should have taken ML which is I think more about the ideas and what they mean. I spend way more hours on this class then in any other I have taken previously yet my grade doesn\'t reflect that. So, take the class but know what you are in for. Be prepared to make sure your job isn\'t going to have any overnight emergencies or anything. There were many who didn\'t struggle as much as I did so ymmv but and I did go in very green.

This is both good and bad as the assignments act more like cookie cutter puzzles cut off of a completed project that you must fill in with your own pieces.

The assignments are auto-graded and you get multiple (from 5 to unlimited) attempts to submit the assignment and you know your grade for that assignment immediately. I really liked that.

I had a hard time taking them seriously, most of the time prof. Starner and assistants try to paint a relaxed and jokey/fun atmosphere, in some sort of popularity contest style. Laudable try, but unfortunately it made the lectures lack the rigor they needed, which proved a problem for assignments. It was impossible (IMO) to approach any assignment with the lectures only, which presented a problem in itself - if one puts 3-4h/week in lectures, just to have to read another 3h from the AI book, that makes the lectures kind of useless. And one needs all the time possible for assignments.\nDon\'t want to insist too much, but various other things added to frustration: fighting Bonnie (with its arcane errors) for assignments, fighting with TAs about solutions for mid/end term exams, the grading on the curve (\"is it enough a 90% to get an A, when most assignments have 100% as median???\"), opening the course with \"adversarial search\" instead of with actual \"search algos\", and many other small issues.\nMaybe I\'m too biased already, I would recommend people buy the AI book and study it at their own pace.

Cramming a dense 16 week course into 12 weeks without omitting anything was ambitious. But then Dr. Starner was on sabbatical at Google all summer (working on Google Glass). So, our head instructor was one of Dr. Starner\'s Ph. D. students, and he hadn\'t been involved with an OMSCS course before. That led to some issues that I\'d never experienced or heard of in other OMSCS courses.\nThe good news is that I learned a lot. The R&N textbook is good. There were 6 fun and instructive programming projects. Each had an autograder with a submission cap (e. g., 1/hr or 20 total). I averaged 20 hr/project and got to 100 on 5 of the 6 projects. On project 3 (Bayes Networks), I only got to 85 after 37 hours and 20 submissions. Thankfully, we got to drop our lowest project grade.\nThe videos were from three different people and had dramatically different quality. Thad Starner\'s videos were great - professional and easy to follow. Peter Norvig\'s videos were ok - made with home video but with good explanations. Sebastian Thrun\'s videos were terrible - made with home video and with awful explanations. Thrun\'s videos covered some of the hardest topics (e. g., Bayes Networks), so they were a big disappointment.\nThe midterm and final exams were take-home, and they were good learning tools. They made me dig into several areas deeper. Each exam required a lot of TA clarifications on Piazza, but the TAs graded the tests fairly trying to take all the clarifications into account. The TAs were cool about regrade requests too if you could justify why you needed one.\nI averaged 22 hours per week and had an A before the curve. My only prior Python use was in the CN course (CS 6250), so I didn\'t know Numpy. This course takes hard work, but I strongly recommend that you only take it during a full semester when Dr. Starner is available to manage the course.

I had taken KBAI the summer before which had given me some good experience in Python and some Numpy. Given that KBAI was my first experience with Python and Numpy, I still did not have a ton of experience going into this class. AI really improved my knowledge of Numpy and pushed me to learn how to write faster code (vectorized) using Numpy. This was something I had never done until this class and was required to meet some of assignment run-time requirements.\nAll the projects were fun and interesting. This really helped me learn the topics thoroughly and dive deeper into each of the topics. What wound up working best for me was to just watch the videos, get good enough understanding of the current topic, then start the projects and read the book as needed. If I had more time I would have liked to read all the material but given that the summer class is shorter with the same amount of content covered in the class, and that I was travelling during some of the class I didn\'t have time to do everything.\nOne thing I really appreciated about this class is that it also had a Machine Learning section and project that has now piqued my interest in ML! Before taking this class I had no real exposure to ML and now I\'ll probably wind up taking the official ML class.\nGrading feedback could have been a lot better / faster.

I managed to complete each of them in 3-5 days max (8-12 hours). Notice however I always started working around 5 days after each assignment was posted. In that way, I avoided wasting time with bugs or asking for clarifications on the instructions. It\'s a good idea to find that sweet spot: not too early, not too late.\nSome topics were review for me (Bayes Nets, Decision Trees, SA and EM from ML; HMMs, VI, PI, min-max from RL; Kalman filters from CV). But I got out a lot from the class regardless - for example I got to implement some algorithms which I \"stole\" when I took ML. The projects I enjoyed the most were the Game Playing Agent, and Tri-directional search.\nI liked the exams and their \"open book\" format, I think they successfully covered important material, and conducted me to learn and reinforce the theory.\nAs others have mentioned, there were some (sometimes many) kinks and bugs in assignments and exams, but instructors were fair with respect to that (we got an extension due to some unclear instruction for some assignment, and we also got free bonus points for a couple of ambiguous exam questions).\nI only wish I had taken this class before other classes like ML, RL, but I guess then it would have taken me like 1. 5x the time.

I found the readings easy to understand due to how the amazing job the writers did. I made an effort to read all suggested chapters after watching the lectures. This will definitely help you to succeed in both the assignments and the exam.\nAssignments: Start early studying the requirements for these. Identify which part of the material you will need to solve them. However, don\'t start coding right away, the instructors were still making some modifications after the release date. Always prioritize coding efficiently. All assignments can be completed with runtimes less than 30 seconds. This will help you perform tests and modify your code faster. If your code is taking longer than that go back and try to find where it can be improved.\nExams: There were a midterm and a final both take home exams. Make sure you are caught up with the material (or at least most of it) before taking them. The questions are not hard and instructors were always there to clarify any possible ambiguity. They were also lenient with some questions when several students had a different interpretation of the problem statements. NOTE: Submit your pdf with what you did to get to the answer. They will give you partial credit if you got the answer wrong but your thought process was correct.\nStaff: In my opinion, the TAs did great.

The projects were error-laden, and the staff participation on Piazza was below-average; however, office hours and instructor participation in the class were much better than other classes. The projects were not particularly difficult (similar to RL or CV), but there was not a single graded exercise this semester (assignment or exam) that didn\'t contain obvious mistakes/errors. Sometimes the staff would acknowledge the issue and make a correction, and other times... not.\nIt was not beneficial to start the project early (because of the errors), but it also didn\'t always pay to start them too late because they would often make changes to the assignments after they were officially released. The autograder (i. e., \"Bonnie\") used to grade assignments would get overloaded the weekend that assignments were due and cause all kinds of reliability problems.

(One assignment involving MCMC is covered in the lecture for only 90 seconds). Unlike many classes where the starter code provides a lot of the minutia functionality, this class you pretty much build from the ground up. The starter code when provided is sparsely documented and seems hastily prepared. Got the impression that each TA was assigned the task of creating one homework for the class, but then those assignments weren\'t tested or validated by the other TAs/Instructor prior to launch. In many of the other classes, (like Intro to CV or KBAI) the assignments, while hard, show polish from having been refined over the years rather than being rushed to meet production deadline.\nThe biggest problem though is that after an assignment, there\'s no follow up by staff as to what the right approach or solution might have been. Didn\'t get it solved? Too bad. Students aren\'t allowed to share solutions or general approaches after the fact either. Makes it hard to learn if you struggle with an assignment but then get no feedback other than a grade. There was discussion of this being due to Piazza. Hopefully on future iterations the TAs/Staff will figure out how to lock it down so that they don\'t have to worry about future students finding the previous class forums.\nApparently the curve is generous, so supposedly everybody will be getting Bs or As.

I was a philosophy major as an undergrad and had no issue with the writing, but others seemed to struggle. We were expected to write on 3-5 topics per assignment, and usually had a ~1500 word limit per assignment overall. In total, the most you were supposed to write for the assignments was 14,000 words, with a recommended length of 10,000 words. The project was another 2,000 words recommended, and you were capped at 2,400. If the idea of writing 17,000 words scares you, don’t take this class.\nThe exams were quite reasonable. The median grade clocked in at around 85% for both exams, and David gives an obscene amount of statistics and analysis on the tests. It was really cool to see.\nYour grade is 35% homework, 20% project, 35% tests, and 10% participation. You can get participation in a bunch of ways, such as Piazza, peer feedback, and completing surveys.\nOver the course of the course, you follow an entire design cycle in the homeworks.

I struggled with some serious health problems during the course and was force to take an incomplete as I couldn’t finish the project on time, but I found the assignments quite manageable and wouldn’t have had an issue if not for the health problems. That said, I was a philosophy major and so was much more comfortable with the writing than many of my classmates.\nI spent about 12 hours a week on the course, of which 7 was spent on homework + projects, 2 on lectures, and 3 on partipation and auxillery things like skimming the papers.

You will learn \"principles\" and \"methods\" and then apply them to an area of research you have chosen and write weekly essays to demonstrate your knowledge.\nParticipation points can be earned in a number of ways. It\'s sort of like an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can participate in surveys, contribute to discussions in piazza, do peer feedbacks on others\' essays. You can do a little of this, a little of that, or whole lot one thing until you hit the maximum 100 points (for 10% of the grade).\nExams were not easy. I think the average on the exams were ~85%, which means the average student had to do better than 90% on everything else to get an A, since the grading was straight scale.\nThe professor, Dr. Joyner is by far the best professor I\'ve had. Truly knows what\'s he\'s talking about, and very passionate about the subject. You will learn a LOT in this course. Every student in the program should take this course.','Medium','Loved!','12 hours/week'),('CS-6750: Human-Computer Interaction','OPmsGwke5CVNel6FWaBZFAjAqoq2','I felt like this was the most useful course (career wise) that I have taken thus far in the program. The ability to analyze software critically and in technical terms cannot be overrated. Even if you have a good understanding and intuition for interfaces, I guarantee you will improve dramatically in this course. Even if you do not work with interfaces (I mainly work in machine vision, c++, and python land), you will still benefit from the ability to think critically about how you can make APIs that others can use effectively.\nFinally, and most importantly, you will come to appreciate everything from a properly marked door, to a well designed car radio, to dragging folders around on your desktop, to any other technology you interact with day after day.\nBonus points:\nDr. Joyner is awesome, and actively contributes to the class.

I was able to finish the entire coursework about 4 weeks early (except Test 2 which was opened a week later). The class is entirely essay/test based so if you want a break from coding/debugging for a term this is one to take. I personally find that coding assignments are a bit more unpredictable in time commitment than writing assignments so this is a great class if you need to front load/work ahead as I had to.

Dr. Joyner was the professor during the Summer 2018 semester, and his interest and enthusiasm for the class and the program as a whole does carry through via weekly updates, the discussions he encourages on Piazza, and via the video lessons.\nThis class is a good introduction class and a bridge between elements of Computer Science and Human Psychology which is not something I\'ve previously been exposed to in a single class at GT undergrad nor GT grad. I\'ve taken CS classes and Psychology classes, but never anything that merged the two.\nIt\'s a course that is less technical and not focused on software or coding; instead, the class involves a lot of reading and writing. For many technical folks like myself, writing is hard and reading is slow, so be aware of that. Having some experience (novice level) with image manipulation or UI mockup tools is very helpful and fun. I now use these mockup & image editing tools in my day job.\nIf you took HCI as your first class in the OMS program, you might come away with the idea that all GT CS classes will be like this. Note that most classes expect more coding, strong programming skills, and \"traditional CS\" stuff. However, if you are taking HCI in between many of those \"traditional CS classes\", it is a breadth of fresh air because it is so different than a \"traditional CS class\".

You are assigned three student papers at random weekly to review; these peer reviews are likely the least effective thing in the course with many of your fellow students offering a whole sentence or two as \'feedback\'. You also have 3-5 required readings each week which reinforce the Udacity lectures (well done by Dr. Joyner, updated frequently). There is no programming required.\nThe basic course structure entails learning the principals and methods of HCI, with weekly assignments being split between the two tracks. Assignments are used to demonstrate a grasp of concepts prior to the projects which put you through re-designing an interface of your choice. Workload is manageable, allow a couple of hours for the readings, 1-2 more for the lectures, anywhere from 2-6 for the assignment/projects. You do have to allot 4-6 more hours early in the semester to take mandatory Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) training.\nThe grading system is a work in progress; this semester, assignments and projects were graded on hard A-B-C-D-F basis with an equal number of points for each grade (e.g. for a project worth 150 points, each grade gets you 37.5 points). Tests were multiple choice with you receiving 1 point for each answer you correctly selected or did not select. For some reason the grade scheme allowed basically anyone to get a B because the total number of points to get a B was 626 of the available 1000 points (63%). An 88% overall grade gets you an A. There was a TA shortage as the semester progressed (several had to drop for one reason or another), so grading slowed substantially the second half of the semester. The TAs were basically invisible other than grading and the very occasional answer on Piazza, but their absence was not felt because Dr. Joyner was so engaged. NOTE: Dr Joyner today (6May18) said that this will be the last semester of the letter grade experiment, so expect a return to traditional point-based grading.\nThis was a very enjoyable course thanks to the energy and enthusiasm Dr. Joyner displays for the material and online learning.

These are fine and will help you understand the material well. They can get a bit boring after awhile though.\nThere are two projects. The individual project isn\'t difficult at all and I felt it was just like another assignment. The group project was a repeat of 5 of the assignments you had already done, but now in a group.

Dr. Joyner is a fantastic instructor, and this course was one of the best I\'ve taken in the OMSCS program.\nBefore I took this course, I had a vague sense of what made a poor user interface, and this course teaches you the underlying principles of usability and user-centered design. After the course, I can now analyze and articulate how an interface could be improved based on user-centered design principles.\nThe course has two main lesson tracks that were taught in parallel: Methods and Principles.\nMethods focuses on the process of conducting HCI research such as understanding regulations about testing with human subjects, performing needfinding (understanding needs of the user), brainstorming approaches, prototyping, and evaluating designs. All of this is comprises the design lifecycle.\nPrinciples focuses on the design principles in HCI, such as the Gulf of Execution (how the user figures out what they want to do and how to do it) and the Gulf of Evaluation (did the interface respond how the user expected?). You also will learn about concepts that improve usability and the limitations of users (human abilities). This was my favorite portion of the course.\nAssignments: Weekly assignments were due that usually required 1200-1500 words of writing based on that week\'s lecture content. I found these assignments to be easy but useful. I usually spent 3-4 hours writing each assignment, but the Methods assignments required outside work that took a few hours to perform (conducting needfinding with others, developing prototypes, etc).\nTests: There are two tests that cover the first half of the course and the second half of the course. The two tests are open-book and open-note (including Udacity and papers) extremely straightforward (not necessarily easy), but there\'s no trickery involved or gotcha questions. Dr. Joyner provided a terrific analysis after the exams to identify problematic questions and other potential test issues.\nProjects: There is an individual project and a group project where you go through a round of the design lifecycle by yourself (individual project) and then as a group (group project).

The readings are lengthy at times and there are multiple to get through. I found it hard to digest and remember the opinions of each author/researcher, but getting through the readings helped me to better understand the theory behind HCI and the many views around it.

The first 3 assignments & the individual project were doable with the 1 week/submission schedule. However, the second phase of M assignments go through a complete cycle of a UI design, from needs finding to prototype construction and evaluation. Almost all of these all require input from an external group: either friends or family or the other students for the need finding and review activities. The same has to be done, this time in a group context for the group project. A little more time is allowed for the group project as it only has to be in at the end of the semester.\nThe logistics of that into a forced march of a 1 week cadence make this unworkable for me to integrate into work&school&travel.\nI think if one is able to dedicate a non Summer semester to this alone, it could be doable. But for Summer, I think the course workload is unrealistic. Just too much logistics which detract from the content. It would be better to have a single project, with enough time to get all the reviewers logistics organized and submit towards the end of the semester. I don\'t think it\'s necessary to have a group project. Any advantages from a group can be had from allowing students to review the various steps, and better yet, be able to incorporate that feedback into your work. (The way a real review at work would be used).\nBTW one disappointment is that in order to have a project you can use at work, you need to submit an application to an IRB of some sort. Again this throws in a logistical detail, as something like cannot be organized within a week, yet, that\'s all you have if you keep to the 1 week cadence. Without some incredible foresight or preparation, the whole thing is unworkable for a custom project.

I tracked the time I spent on this class down to the minute, and spent an average of 9 hours a week watching lectures, doing assignments, or reading Piazza. This is definitely a class where you\'ll get out of it what you put into it. There are extra reading assignments that you can do (for fun), you can interact on Piazza about questions offered up in the videos, and Dr. Joyner really tries to facilitate student interaction on Piazza. Also, these videos were by far my favorite in the program (out of 10 classes taken).\nThe assignments were generally pretty straightforward writeups that were directly correlated with the lectures. We learned and went through the design lifecycle over the course of 5 assignments (1 assignment/week). While parts of this felt a little rushed due to the need to get outside participation in surveys or interviews in a week\'s span, the assignments themselves were light (~1000 words), yet informative. This class provided a glimpse into what it looks like to iterate through the design lifecycle with a focus on user-centered design, which I felt was informative and necessary for creating high quality solutions to problems.\nI would be slightly concerned about a lack of rigor during the fall or spring semesters, when students have 6 extra weeks to move through the material, but I guess there is plenty of room to perform needfinding to a fuller extent or create higher fidelity prototypes.

The second half focuses on the design lifecycle. It gives you a process for designing and refining interfaces. It\'s a very practical approach that I think maps very well to industry.

It is possible to front load things early on, which is a HUGE plus to me.\nNOTE: a review below says you have to fill out your own application to an IRB, that is not true.

I still had to go back and watch lectures for a few questions, but having structured notes made it easy to quickly find that specific lecture.\nEach week had individual assignments which usually take 3-4 hours if you want to do a good job and earn an A. There are word limits, so leave no word unturned and revise, revise, revise to fit that word count! Taking notes for all the coursework can be really helpful in your written work because you will need to refer to the concepts you learn in the lectures.\nThere is an individual project that you can complete over time, or within a week if you dedicate a few hours a day to it - I did feel a bit rushed to complete it before the deadline.

Be ready to learn how to write surveys or perform interviews, which can be challenging if you are lacking in soft skills!\nOne of the more interesting experiences you\'ll have with Dr. Joyner is that this is very much an \"open standard\" (not necessarily \"open source\") course. When students post feedback about the course structure, or something that didn\'t work quite right, Dr. J is extremely forthright about how he might change or improve the course.

You often have a choice between which material you wish to discuss, so as long as you illustrate you understood those topics and provide a reasonable answer to solve the posed problem it\'s not too difficult. I would recommend using lots of figures, since the word limit can sometimes be tight, so flowcharts, pseudocode and illustrations in general are very helpful. Make sure to answer all rubric questions provided for each assignment.\nProjects:The class project is broken into 3 stages. The main overall class project is to develop an AI agent that can solve Ravens Progressive Matrices, a standardized test of intelligence. I say main project since they also allow you the option to complete an alternate project for projects 2 and 3, which involves developing an AI agent chatbot that can answer questions based on answers from an FAQ. At each stage, you deal with progressively harder requirements / problem sets, and you will need to also write a project reflection describing your approach, what you learned and how it connects to KBAI topics. Start projects early, so you don\'t feel overwhelmed trying to rush things last minute. Don\'t neglect the written reflection too, as it\'s normally 40-50% of each project, and make sure to again follow the project rubric to make sure you answer all questions on each rubric.\nExams:There are 2 take-home examinations, which aren\'t too difficult. They are essay-based, much like the rest of the course aside from project implementations, and you have a week to complete each exam.\nPeer Review:You will also need to complete peer review for all assignments, all 3 project reflections, and the mid-term and final exams. They don\'t want single sentence sort of peer reviews, so you will have to put a bit of effort into leaving some good feedback here.\nTAs: TAs and the prof were all very active on Piazza.

Decent amount of freedom to explore and experiment in the assignments if that\'s what you want to do.\nMy main issue (and it is a big one) is that the material itself feels pretty dated: knowledge-based AI isn\'t really in fashion in our age of ML and deep learning, so I took this course to see if there was still interesting techniques in that domain, and frankly I don\'t think I\'ve been convinced: there is a lot of material in this course, but much of it seems obvious, brittle, or excessively vague.

There really isn\'t anything that helps you synthesize the course concepts. The RPM project only vaguely relates, depending on your approach, and the assignments and exams make it easy to cherry-pick through the lectures to get your answers, which are often somewhat subjective anyway.

There will be two similar sets of questions that you\'ll get when submitted to the autograder, here to, one graded, one not. Then came the writing, there is a lot of writing in this class. Three project reflections, three assignments on nothing related to the class, a midterm and a final. Totally 15, 000+ words on the minimum, and if you want to secure a good grade, at least 20, 000. This not only became a drain, but a bother to complete. The lectures had little to do with the class, and the depth was nonexistent. I feel that I learned little, while just enjoying the programming and creativity. However, the TAs were lenient in grading and very understanding. As a whole, we started to somewhat complain that our midterm and final essays were high level architectures with little value, so they offered an alt-final, where students could develop their midterm NLP chatbot design into a real program, I can\'t image many other teachers agreeing to offer a second final for students who didn\'t feel they were learning enough.

Students are given very little constructive feedback between iterations. Submission results in Bonnie give very little feedback as well - some students were getting timeouts, memory errors, other errors - but system returns nothing specific and TAs were not helpful on Piazza.

At first I thought just watching lectures would be enough, but the lectures don\'t actually teach you anything of substance to answer these assignment questions.

First, in the project work, you never really got the opportunity to implement the learnt methods. The problems are getting more and more difficult as the course progress, the absolute majority of the course participates (including myself) has to code more and more complex and specific rule sets, which is tedious and boring. Instead of solving more complex problems, I would be happier to stay with simpler ones but try more advanced methods, e. g. , learning by correcting mistakes, version space, to build my agent with learning capabilities. There are reviews saying you do not have to watch the course video to be able to work with the project, which is true to some extent. Second, the assignments are the worst part of the course. For example, you are asked to design a self-driving agent using one of the method discussed in the lecture in 1000 words and one of the grading rubric is on the feasibility of the proposed solution. Self-driving car is not even in mass production, how can we describe a feasible proposal in 1000 words?

He is very active on piazza and sometimes I wondered whether he slept at all :) Piazza threads are super organized, so if when there were close to 10, 000 posts, you could read what was relevant to you. I have no ML or AI background, given that I found the lectures very informative, some students in the class who had taken ML didn\'t like the contents much! The lectures make the concepts look very easy because they use very simple daily life example but when you want to write the assignment on a useful AI problem, it is very very tough!! The projects are solving RPM puzzles; while it was enjoyable and rewarding to write python programs that solve complex visual analogy puzzles, I felt let down that I couldn\'t use any of the AI concepts that we learnt in them. At the end of each video David Joyner does gives tips on how the techniques could be used in RPM puzzle but even then it was difficult applying them. Videos talk a lot about learning and reasoning but we were given no guidance on how to write such a program. From Spring 2016, the course work is cut down a bit, we only had 3 assignments, 3 projects, 1 midterm and 1 final. We get 3 weeks for doing the project and 1 week for assignments. Midterm and final are both open ended and open book and are given 1 week each. I have given 15 hours/week but I think you can do with 10 hours/week if you are very goal oriented and super focused unlike me.

Be aware that this is not an AI course, this is rather an introductory knowledge-representation course. The course is not hard and you can make it fun but it is up to you. The lectures are mere overview of the topics, my undergrad AI course gave me much deeper knowledge on AI. You\'re on your own discovering the topics; lots of readings are presented so you can dig deeper if you\'d like. Which is nice. But I would go as far as don\'t even waste your time watching lectures if the title sounds familiar to you - for example there is a lecture on classification but it does not go into any mathematical or implementation detail whatsoever. If you\'ve taken an AI, ML or CV class before (or you\'ve read a few pages on wikipedia about statistical classification), you already know more than it is presented in the class. Written assignment are fine, they are short and as the class doesn\'t, neither are you required to go into technical details. The grading of the papers is a bit of a lottery, depends a lot on the reviewer. I got points taken away for totally contradicting reasons between two assignments. The coding homework is fun but barely has anything to do with the class materials. Turns out you better off implementing stuff on your own (hardcoding lots of stuff) and later claim that this for cycle is \'learning by recording cases\' and those if conditionals are \'decision trees\' or whatever. So all in all interesting ideas are presented, coding can be fun (but time consuming if you\'re not good at Python), the papers are not hard and grading is generous but there is no connection between these. Requirements are not always clear and you never really know where you at performance-wise which caused frustration for some. You can easily get a B or A in this class with very small effort - papers can be done in an hour or two, you can skim through videos quickly and the 3 programming assignments can be done during a weekend.

I thought the projects and/or assignments would account for that but there was little connection between the projects and the course material. In fact, if you try to apply many of the lecture concepts to your agent you\'ll likely spend more time than other students and up with an underperforming agent because they simply aren\'t a good fit. The projects are fun in of themselves if a bit repetitive. A poll was taken on how much time students spent on the first project and it spanned from 10-50+ hours, with the mean seemingly somewhere in the 20s. It seems that students with deeper algorithmic programming experience found the projects pretty easy, while others struggled monumentally. The assignments are just written essays that involve describing/applying a given technique, kind of like thought exercises, without actually building anything and therefore resulting in a ton of wiggle room.

As alluded to above, if you have some algorithmic development under your belt, you can do better than average without even thinking about a KBAI algorithm. There was a ton of writing for the class.

Drs. Goel and Joyner are very serious about the course and very skilled at course management, meaning that you get a clear notion of what you ought to be doing to succeed, and how you are supposed to use the various tools (Piazza, lectures,... ) effectively. It also means that you get great feedback through the peer review system, and timely assignment grades (which was a problem in my other course). They work to stagger due dates and they publish all due dates at or near the beginning of the term (in the initial syllabus, in fact), which makes it possible for you to plan well if you have other classes or major work commitments. In terms of learning, you get out of the class more or less what you put into it. I didn\'t have time to implement the number of alternative algorithms I really wanted to on the projects (particularly the later ones), but that wasn\'t necessary to get a decent grade. In terms of the subject matter, I loved what the course covered, but I am biased since AI is my area of particular interest. I felt that coding the agent was fun but that students without some prior exposure to image processing datastructures were at a disadvantage. You will find this class easy if you: are efficient and good at expressing ideas in writing, are fluent at coding in Java or Python, and have sat in on an image processing course at some point in time (it\'s fine if you think you\'ve forgotten everything).

I\'ll list the pros and cons:\nPros:\nExcellent TA and instructors, obviously cared about the class, very very involved in Piazza, and excellent to talk to.\nEasy A. Projects are not that hard if you\'re confident in programming, and are really easy in terms of grading. Last two projects had means in the 60s(which is also the threshold for an A), and I ended with grades in the high 80s with a couple of hours of effort.\nCons:\nWay too many things. I don\'t really understand why you need 4 projects, 5 assignments, a midterm and a final?? Oh wait and also peer feedback/participation. I spent way too much time on this class for nowhere close to enough gain.\nGrading is a joke. a. Project grading is virtually completely based on how many problems your agent solves, which de-incentivzes you to try anything creative. b. Assignment/midterm/final grading is absurd. I did well on them all, but it seems to completely arbitrary. I would get a below mean grade on an assignment with a comment \'Good job\', or points docked off with no explanation, or a really good score on an obviously half-assed assignment.\nPeer feedback is quite useless. Started off well for maybe one assignment, after which point it became obvious that people were just doing it to get your participation grade, and not really reading the assignments. Not to mention they made it compulsory to do peer feedback for assignments that you didn\'t even attempt.\nContent is useless. Ah, this was my biggest gripe with this course. The material taught in the class did not seem practical at all. Maybe I\'m amazingly misunderstanding the course material, but it seems to be mostly common sense that they somehow manage to come up with more and more terminology for. And I don\'t mean trying to understand how common sense works, no, I mean the concepts that they understand seemed hardly worthy of a class. If you look at any practical AI, it\'s machine learning and mathematical approaches. I think I learned absolutely nothing in this class.\nProjects are unrelated to course content. I got excellent grades on all the projects, but I saw basically no relation to the content taught in the class. I would have done equally well had I not watched a single video(except for the project report, where I had to shoehorn concepts to the actual project)','Medium','','15 hours/week'),('CS-7637: Knowledge-Based AI: Cognitive Systems','c36c1a3f-6655-4f31-b0a4-971fdc87fbe6','By far my favorite class in the OMSCS program so far.

Grading is completely results based (how many did it solve?), so in the interest of solving as many problems as I could, I have not delved deep into the advanced concepts that we have learned in lecture, because if you\'re even somewhat busy, you\'re just going to apply the concepts that will solve the most problems in the least amount of time it takes to write (instead of spending the time to apply as many concepts as it takes to solve all the problems). I would much rather have the class have slightly smaller projects that are different each time (like the problems covered in the lectures are way more interesting to me) more specialized toward a concept that forces you to apply new concepts. Another problem I have with this class is the sheer amount of writing we have to do. I\'ve never taken an engineering class where we literally have to write a paper every week.

The first project gets you right into the material and there is extremely minimal guidance on what to do for the first project.\n3> The lectures are as clear but fall short of explaining the topics succinctly. The videos are lively but the extended amount of banter between the two professors draws out the videos and regularly I could not follow their train of thought.\n4> The TAs are not the best I\'ve experienced.

But the course is made harder by a disastrous lecture sequence. What the hell were they thinking when they made the insanely long and meaningless lecture videos. Watching the lectures were a pain and a torture. Too many pointless trash talking that throws one off. They should really learn from Andrew ng\'s course in coursera and how to make the videos relevant and to the point. Heck, the videos of ML4T is so good and the explanations were so concise and clear. On the contrary, in ML there were too many hand waving, lame jokes, out of context talks and over the air explanation that made no sense or too difficult to comprehend. If you solely relied on lectures for this course, you are destined to not only fail but do worse than not watching anything at all. Its that bad. Prof Isbell is a smart guy but arrogant. Don\'t dare to ask him any obvious questions or he will ruin your credit history (He joked this in one of his Piazza posts). His answers are always standard, I DON\'T CARE. The ML office hours are absolutely a waste of time. The TAs handling the OH are students who have no clue what they are talking. At times they seem lost in explaining even the basic stuff. And the projects description is the biggest joke of all. No clear instructions at all. All it says is, steal the code, I don\'t care. But write a report. Really? Even the lamest of a description would be better than that. Piazza is a total chaos with questions from confused students and equally confusing explanation. I am sorry to rant but this is not a very well run course. If there is anything wrong with OMSCS, it would be the way this course is run. A perfect example of a poorly designed and mismanaged course.

The old adage of research professors not caring about their classes is fully exemplified in this class. The professors main interaction with the students is to tell them that he doesn\'t care at all, about what they use for projects or how they do them. His flippancy carries over to the TAs, and thus piazza is a jumbled, awful mess.\nThe assigments are also awful. Instead of giving you anything to really go off, the class asks you to find some data set to use, and then re-use for all further assignments. If you, like me, don\'t really have any strong opinions or desire to explore any specific data, then this sucks! You wind up picking some random data sets, and then having to manufacture some problems for them, and then your lack of real interest in them shows through in the papers. In my opinion, no data set is really going to be that interesting, and if it is, then it probably can\'t be explored in the few weeks you have to do the assignment while also presumably working full-time.\nPerhaps this whole thing is being exacerbated also by the fact that I just got done taking Human-Computer Interaction with Dr. David Joyner, whose enthusiasm for teaching shows in every part of his course. He is a true professor, interested in interacting with and working with his students to ensure that they have a great learning experience. It could also be because I took Machine Learning for Trading two semesters ago with Dr. Balch (who is also a great professor), and that class had amazing assignments that were well thought out and provided you with a solid starting point for exploration and learning. Those assignments also came with expected results and test cases to check your work!\nI think this class could be fixed if they would give you the datasets and the code to run them. If all they really care about is the conclusions you draw from the results of running the code, then I think that would be the easiest thing to do. It would give them a stronger basis on which to grade things, because the data sets and results would be known, and it would free the students to really focus on the analysis, which is all that the class says that it wants. Even with that, they could still give you places to tweak the knobs if they really wanted to. There just is a big disconnect between what the professor says he wants and what the students actually need to do for the assignments.\nOf course, to fix it, the professors would have to care about it, and as mentioned above, they don\'t.\nIf you are interested in the topic, the videos are alright, and the book recommended, Machine Learning by Tom M. Mitchell, is quite good. However, the assignments really detract from the course overall, and so I would strongly recommend against taking it if you can help it.

Review might be updated after end of Semester)\nI am torn about this class but ultimately have to say that is not a good course and the Prof has been very overrated. First the good stuff:\nPros:\n1) Some of the lectures are actually interesting and well presented with some theory and insights that I would not have gotten elsewhere (Note: only some. see below)\n2) Assignments do give you practical ML experience working on real datasets.\n3) You get good feedback on assignments\nCons:\n1) Most lectures however are atrocious when you compare them to the other MOOCs. Andrew Ng set a high bar 5 years ago and if you took his MOOC you are walking out very little new knowledge that he didn\'t already explain much better. ML Theory part in particular is presented in an awful way. Neural Networks? We get a crappy subpar 15 min explanation on them.\n2) The Professor is awful. Isbell is rude, antagonistic and arrogant to his students. He creepily prowls piazza and slack to not answer student questions but to drop bait and then insult students for asking innocent even if they are annoying questions. TA quality is lacking. Slack in particular should be off limits for a Prof to criticize his students.\n3) The material is outdated. The book we use is 20 years old.The entire last 10 years worth of developments are ignored in this course so you end up wasting time on really old and less useful stuff like KNN or Decision Tree or K means which are not as important anymore. Tree and Instance based learning in particular has fallen out of favor and is seen by almost everyone in the ML community as a complete dead end yet we spend so much of the course talking about Decision Trees and stuff like KNN. Important and still very relevant topics like logistic regression and regularization is not even discussed in this course. There is also zero mention of deep learning here.\n4) Professor is sloppy and lazy and it shows in his assignments. They are poorly worded full of ambiguities and required stuff is not mentioned in there. Only casually in office hours. If students ask clarifying questions they are insulted. I personally stopped asking questions cause the professor was this rude.\n5) The assignments themselves are questionable in what they are teaching you. Lots of time spent hyperparameter tweaking. No real mathematucal rigor to any of it. Just throw some stuff see if it works blah and write a report with some charts. Not hard but very tedious and distracting from what we should be learning. You also have to get your own dataset so most people end with bad ill suited datasets for the problems and have no choice but to keep using them ending up with poor results and sub par papers to write\n6) Exams are dumb. Having taken AI the ML exams are disappointing. They make you write essay questions that encourage rote memorization in an ML exam. No math. Very little theory. Just cram as much and then hope you can remember. Only two Problem sets given to test your understanding but they\'re completley garbage because the \"answers\" are links to chapters in the book.

This course surveys techniques in Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. There are only 4 assignments so you have several weeks to do each, but each one covers broad regions of the ML landscape. Part of the difficulty of each assignment is figuring out what is most important to include in your writeup. This seems to be deliberate. Guidelines are given regarding grading, but they don\'t tell you exactly what you need to do to get a high score. This frustrates some people, but I think it\'s reasonable because this is grad school, not undergrad, and we need to develop the ability to do independent research and determine on our own what is important, what questions to ask, how to get answers to those questions, etc. If we can\'t do those things we\'ll never be able to discover or invent something new.\nYou are free to write your code in whatever language you choose. Mostly you\'ll choose a library with the ML algorithms you need instead of writing everything from scratch (which would require a superhuman effort). Python and scikit-learn are popular as is Weka and other Java libraries.\nThis course isn\'t about becoming an expert in ML (that would be impossible in 1 semester).

The two professors are really entertaining, they did a great job in adding colors to the materials which are dry in nature. I love most of the lectures except the one on Markov Decision Process. To me, it would be more intuitive to walk through an example of value iteration before throwing tons of equations at the audience. The course did exactly the opposite which gave me a hard time. Outside the lectures, the course itself is depressing. There are four assignments in the course. They are asking serious a lot for each. I would expect to spend 100 hours for each assignment to get to the place where they expect you to be. Unfortunately it is not realistic since i am juggling between job, family and study as most of us here. The grading criteria should be better communicated, my overall impression is that the grading lacks consistency. TAs give grade based on their personal tastes. The feedback should be more constructive and to motivate students to explore more. To me, the feedback is only a list of missing tests which are only implied in the assignment specification. I was discouraged each time after reading the TA\'s feedback. Overall, this is a reasonably well organized course.

That is what the grading is like. There is another review that states \"... we need to develop the ability to do independent research ...\". This doesn\'t do anything in that regard. Assignments are meant to hone your understanding of the material and a rubric helps students focus that effort to ensure it\'s not a futile endeavor.

Watch a few of them and you\'ll see the dynamic between professors Isbell and Littman. The order of material, the quizzes, and the examples are all generally good as well.\nExams - A midterm and a final, which only addressed material since the midterm. The exams were straightforward, covered a nice breadth of material, and were appropriately difficult. My only criticism is that the midterm had way more content than time to answer it. The final did not have that problem.\nAssignments - Bittersweet (for me at least). Each of the four was relevant, rewarding, and quite time-consuming. My two main criticisms are 1) you are asked to think deeply on a topic you are presently learning, which, for me, is tough; and 2) the assignments are broadly and loosely scoped. Personally, I finished every assignment feeling as though I learned a ton, but each grade reflected just the opposite. More structure in the assignments would have helped me focus on what I needed to learn rather than waste time trying to figure out what the TA wants me to address.\nOverall: Excellent material that I\'ve been wanting to learn the foundations of for a while.

The material is vast, but the goal is to give you high level understanding of a broad set of tools. Specifically, the professors focus on what certain algorithms do, what specific algorithms are good and bad at, intuition behind how they work, and how they are similar and different from other algorithms. The focus is NOT on how to implement each individual algorithm or how to use specific ML tools and frameworks. I heard or read at some point (maybe even during a lecture?) that one of the goals of the class is to provide students the tools to become ML researchers. I think this course does a great job at that, while also giving students the opportunity to pick up specific tools as they desire.\nIn my opinion, it helps to take DVA before this class if you are not coming from an ML background. Even if you don\'t use the R language for the assignments in this course, that class can get you in the right mindset for what kinds of plots and plot-layouts to put into a report to make the best use of your limited space. Also, that course goes into some detail on logistic and linear regression.

Its a good course, lot more theory than I liked, but it helps you learn. Assignments are basically experiments and documenting the same with no clear instructions on how to conduct those and what kind of experiments to run; I think the idea is to encourage students to explore and learn as much as possible, so that we get learn to decide what is important and what is not. Assignment grading seems unfair at times, and exams are very tough(At least for me). Advice from me; refresh your linear Algebra, and be comfortable with Python/Java so that you can work with ML libraries. At least be in \"listen only\" mode in piazza, office hours, slack channel to get hints on what experiments to run, what curves to draw in the report (I didn\'t do it, and that was a mistake) You will learn a lot. Do not stress yourself with assignment and mid term grades. I found that individual grading may seem brutal, but the overall grading is pretty lenient.

I used to keep listening to their lectures again and again until the concepts got deeply embedded in my brain. The instructors provide the students with a good overview of the theory and derivations both through lectures and piazza materials, but the students are not tested on those in any of the assignments. The midterms and finals were not that difficult, provided the students get accustomed to the structure of the questions beforehand. One way to do that is to solve all assignments of the past Machine Learning courses taught at CMU as well as the exercise problems from Tom Mitchell\'s book that do not require any derivation or proofs. I did all my assignments in JAVA using Weka Library and BURLAP, although Python would have been a better option. Assignments were easy yet time-consuming. In most universities, Machine Learning courses offered by the CS department turn out to be a blend of theory, derivations, analysis and quality code execution, where most students are tested on those. Here students are graded ONLY on analysis. In fact, students are provided with the code or the software for all assignments. I did not enjoy the assignments, as I did not find those challenging enough.

Even after reading all the reviews and professor\'s push, delayed to start the assignment and the price was paid in the assignment marks. I finished running all the experiments but didn\'t have time to write the analysis for which the assignment is graded. Write up is the key. Do not stress much on interesting data sets. Choose two data sets with different type of attributes, <30 in number and with <5000 instances. This will help in running the experiments faster and saving up time for analysis. Later I could score really well in rest of the assignments. Assignments constitute 50% of the grade. Midterm and final constitute rest 50% with equal proportion. Mid term was 1.5 hrs long and final was 3 hrs. Mid term is made purposefully lengthy. It had all T/F questions with 2 points each in the beginning for which a small explanation is required. Later there were 12-20 points questions. So time management is crucial for Midterm. Final had the similar pattern with double amount of time and it was fine. The exams do not require to memorize the proofs or complex equations but basic ones. I have used the following tools/libraries for assignments. 1. WEKA (Java IDE) 2. ABAGAIL (Java) 3. SCIKIT-LEARN (Python) 4. BURLAP (Java). It is better to start the assignment early and to get familiarized with the libraries. Its better to decide on the type of graphs to be produced and stick to them. I always got tempted to include more graphs but ended up not using them due to 10 pages space constraint. It is better to focus on important graphs and good analysis. Guidelines or sample analysis won\'t be available. It is better to read some papers and follow the format.

I actually had to complete one of the assignments while running on a portable gas-powered generator, because the electricity was out at my house due to hurricane Irma; where there\'s a will there\'s a way.

Each of the 4 project assignments took me 35-40 hours. My advice is to start on every assignment early and truly learn from the feedback the TAs give you on them. The assignments are pretty open-ended and they want you to do more than the listed requirements but also do it concisely, so a lot of your time on the assignments will be editing and making sure you cut out fluff and use your words wisely. Also do all the problem sets they make available. You\'ll want to get started on these early too so after discussing solutions on Piazza, you can fully understand the answers before the midterm and final exams.

Not so much as AOS had, but still a fair amount.\nProfessor Isbell and the TAs are pretty responsive on Piazza. Elijah has been very active and helpful in particular.\nThe bulk of the difficulty comes with the projects. They are very open ended: you can use whatever data sets or framework you want to complete them. All of the coding and experimentation is just a set up for the analysis you write, which is the real centerpiece of a project. Writing a good analysis requires really understanding what is going on and will require a fair amount of independent research, above and beyond what the lectures and supplemental reading provide. It\'s tough, but I find that it gives a thorough understanding of the area. For me each of the projects has taken around 50-60 hours to complete. They come at a two to three week cadence.

I don\'t feel that it\'s hard to get a \"B\", but you have to work at it.

This wasn\'t true, at least for me. This class is tedious and time consuming, while 6505 is just plain difficult and time consuming.\nLectures: The lectures did a good job of explaining the various machine learning algorithms. Most lectures described things relatively informally (no rigorous math or proofs). For some of the concepts, I kind of wish they had explained the math behind the algorithm a bit better, but for the most part they were very good\nHomework: The homework is structured as four projects. There were two big issues with the homework. First, there was a sizable gulf between the material presented in the lectures and what you actually had to do for the projects. There was lots of outside reading required to understand how exactly to use the ML algorithms in an analysis setting. In other words, the lectures explained how the algorithms worked but you were on your own with the homeworks in terms of comparing them and determining which performed best and why. Second, you were kind of on your own when it came to picking tools to perform your analysis. As a beginner to these concepts, I spent lots of time evaluating machine learning frameworks to determine which best suited the assignment. This meant I was spending less time actually working with the algorithms and more time experimenting with machine learning libraries. The TAs and professor occasionally made suggestions, but it would have been nice to get a list of vetted frameworks for each project.\nAssembling the reports for the homework was tedious. It involves running multiple (hopefully repeatable), possibly long running experiments and usually plotting the right things for each algorithm.

The difficulty of this course is it covers a ton of material. It mostly glosses over regression and doesn\'t address generalized linear models at all, nor does it go into any kind of graph analytics. There is exactly zero discussion of tools and applications. What you get is the kitchen sink of techniques for taking in data and gaining some understanding of it, as well as optimization and optimal control thrown in for good measure.\nThe treatment of the math is frankly fairly superficial if you have a decent working intuition of probability and linear algebra. There isn\'t much discussion of statistics and it would help to supplement what you get here with some outside reading about resampling, bootstrapping, cross-validation, and various loss functions. You need these to analyze the results you get. You don\'t need to get deep in the weeds with proofs, but understand how and why they work and what you\'re measuring.\nThe biggest thing is don\'t underestimate the assignments. Don\'t get cute trying to build web scrapers or pull real-time data from APIs, doing all kinds of feature engineering. Being a data ninja is fun, but this isn\'t the class for it. You\'ll get zero extra credit for that. Pick something from the UCI repository that is ready to throw into a train function right away. 100% of the points you get are your analysis. Use well-tested library code on simple datasets and put your effort into visualizing and explaining the performance characteristics of each algorithm, because you need to run quite a few of them. Know what a complexity curve is, a learning curve, a confusion matrix, know what the tuning parameters are for each modeling package and know how and why performance changes when you tweak them. And know the performance measures! Be prepared to explain why you would use accuracy, precision, recall, area under the ROC curve, or whatever measure you use. It\'s specific to the problem you\'re trying to solve and this isn\'t covered in lectures or in the required text, so do some outside study.

However in the end I felt it was worthwhile and the projects gave a lot more hands-on practice with some of the methods we studied in the class.\nThe first half of the class can be a bit daunting in terms of the amount of material for the midterm - Supervised Learning covers a lot of lectures and most of the textbook for the class. The latter half of the class is a bit less material with respect to studying for the final. In that respect you should try to stay on or ahead of the schedule and readings so you don\'t feel overwhelmed getting prepared for the midterm.\nIn terms of the projects, the first one can feel daunting as you must select two datasets to use for this project (and reuse them for parts of later projects) and then apply a bunch of supervised learning methods to the data sets and then compare and contrast. Without giving things away, I would say on that first project try to focus on getting some plots that will help you to compare the algorithms in terms of different parameters, error rates and runtimes. Having the plots is really crucial to doing well on the assignments. As I moved on through the course I also found it helpful to write the report as I went along instead of running a ton of experiments and then trying to write it up at the end - since only the report matters for the project grades the most important thing is to start putting words (and plots) to paper, and that can help with \"analysis paralysis\".\nUse the software you are comfortable with for the class. Whether you prefer Python, R, or Java stick with what you like and you will probably be happier. But also the randomized optimization project has a MIMIC implementation in the ABAGAIL package (Java) and the reinforcement learning project works well with BURLAP (Java), and using those may make things easier for those projects.\nIf you do use java and want to get a head start on the class one activity that would be useful it watching the Weka tutorial, which walks through how to load data in Weka and use the different classifiers and classifier parameters in Weka. Learning to use either the Weka CLI or APIs to programmatically run classifiers is also helpful as you can use that to run a series of experiments to see how tuning parameters in the learning algorithms impacts the results.\nFinally believe Charles when he says not to panic on the midterm results. The mean on our midterm was around 50/100 but that corresponded to the equivalent of an A, and the B range was 20-30 points and up.

I utilized many outside resources for this (there are excellent resources out there). So, overall, it didn\'t really feel like a course, more like a reference.

The parts that I enjoyed were where I had a flash of inspiration and was able to come up with applciations of the problems to solve things that I found cool, but without those flashes just meant that you are spending hours and hours thinking about random datasets that aren\'t really that exciting. The assignments are very open ended, and they basically just say \'Answer all of the questions that you can think of about [something]\', but do note that there are specific requirements that you are graded against, you just don\'t get to see them in advance. This didn\'t impact me very much, but I know that others were annoyed that they lost points for something that wasn\'t specifically called out as a requirement. The TAs went through bursts of being responsive, but then we wouldnt hear much for weeks. Oh, and the peer review system that they set up was worthless.

The assignments are painfully long and the grading is so frustratingly inconsistent. Most of the time a assignment requires to solve twice the same problem for no other reason than to take up your time. There is so much material covered that we learn everything to a very shallow level and the math that everybody seems to be scared about is never used during the assignments nor during the exams (which makes the math requirements quite low I think).

There is NO difference between taking RL in a summer or in a full semester. Unlike other courses, in RL there are NO cut-downs of assignments, projects. You just have less time to complete everything.\nCoursework: 3 projects and 6 assignments/homeworks and 1 exam.\nExtra credit is offered in 1 homework, but it\'s a very very small contribution to your overall grade.\nYou can kinda front-load work because the assignments and projects are released in batches. It\'s 2 assignments+1 project released at once with different deadlines for each deliverable (project having the most time).\nThe assignments/homeworks are just graded on the output of your program. No need for reports, but you need good understanding of readings and lectures to solve these problems.\nThe grading of the project is primarily focused on your report (5 pages total MAX including everything) - unlike ML, you CAN\'T steal code - you have to implement RL algorithms yourself and write a detailed technical report describing all the why\'s/how\'s/if\'s of the observations you saw in your experiments. P1 and P3 are paper replication+analysis and P2 is the most interesting one where you teach an agent to play a game. Hardest one for me was P3. Make sure you have enough time for it since you will also have to study for your exam.\nThe final part (25% of your grade) depends on the final closed-book ProctorTrack exam. If you are taking the course in the summer, you better catch up with weekly reading or you are going to have one helluva time during the finals. EVERYTHING in the lectures+reading is a fair game for the final exam. If you don\'t do well on exams, better get high marks on the 3 projects and the homeworks you have (which account for 75% of your grade) and hope for the best in the exam.\nYou really don\'t need any resources other than the ones provided by TAs and the lectures.

As a result, I dont feel confident about what I\'ve learnt. I participated in the first two help sessions organized by the TAs/TA, I feel the host (sorry I could not match face and name) explain some concepts in a very clear way, yeah, he knows what he is talking about, but after taking this class, I don\'t have that confidence (although I got over 90% in total).\nReflecting in the exam, (25T/F with one or two sentence explanation), I reviewed quite a lot but I still feel the questions are very confusing to me.

They are autograded and you get a few submissions so you know your grade immediately. The first project is replicating a research paper and is relatively easy and not that interesting. Project 2 was a lot of fun, but much harder - it\'s the lunar lander problem from openAI gym. Project 3 was the hardest of the lot, involving linear programming to replicate another research paper. The grading was pretty haphazard and depended heavily on which TA you got. One tip is that the code does not matter at all - it doesn\'t matter if you replicate the research or not, it only matters that you talk about the algorithms used in the research paper. The exam was similar to the T/F questions from ML, and takes about 45 minutes to an hour (no rush).\nThe lectures are comically bad. Unfortunately you do need to watch them to know what is going to be on the exam.

Each is challenging in its own way but once you have that \"aha\" moment they\'re very simple. I never got that with HW1 but I did find another way to do it. And since we run our code on provided test cases and submit answers to an autograder (limit of 10 tries per problem, which I found to be way more than needed, which is good), it doesn\'t matter whether we code it the \"right\" way or not. Overall I had a lot of fun with the HWs.\nProjects are coding with a report. Project 1 was about replicating results in a research paper. I enjoyed it since it was a perfect mix of everything. Challenging, but not so challenging that I just sat there wondering what to even do. It was rewarding to generate results and interesting to compare with classmates\' results. Then came the grades. I lost nearly 10% for not doing something that wasn\'t even mentioned in the project description. Well, I actually did do it, but I didn\'t write about it because our reports had a hard limit of 5 pages. Given everything we had to write about and the types of graphs we had to include, it was a real struggle to stay in the limit, so the amount of extra stuff we can put in there is tiny, if anything at all. Based on class feedback it seemed like a common occurrence to lose points for things not specifically required. Speaking of feedback, many students said their feedback on P1 was extremely vague. I didn\'t have this problem on P1, but this was fixed in general for P2 and P3.\nSeveral students asked for full rubrics to clarify the P1 grades, and the TAs were very adamant about not giving those out. I completely understand why they don\'t want to do that (and I was surprised that ML4T essentially does do that), but it would have been nice for them to meet us halfway. It\'s very frustrating to be docked points for something you (1) have no idea you\'re supposed to do, and (2) can\'t fit into the report anyway because you\'re squeezing everything you were told to do in the 5-page limit. I teach and this is something I would never do to my students, which it makes it all the more frustrating.\nP2 was the OpenAI gym lunar lander project. I had fun with this at first but then it turned into a game of \"find the parameters\", which I find tedious, dull, and not educational. Parameter tuning is a big part of ML, RL, CV, etc., and it is why I\'m heavily disinterested in these subjects now. I honestly don\'t know if I even want to take ML anymore.\nP3 was replicating research results again, this time using game theory and linear programming. This was challenging in an unpleasant way (sitting there wondering what to even do) but once I got over that hurdle it was a little more enjoyable, even if it was a little tedious. In the end I lost a few points for reasons similar to P1.\nThis was the first course I\'ve taken where we had absolutely no starter code for projects or homeworks. I like that since it\'s generally more rewarding to code something functional completely from scratch.\nOverall, this is definitely my least favorite class so far. But I highly enjoyed the other ones I\'ve taken, so that\'s not necessarily saying this course is terrible. I guess I\'m glad to have taken it, but... I don\'t know, it just wasn\'t what I was expecting I guess. I absolutely do not recommend this as a first course unless you have some hardcore ML/RL experience.

Starting from week 4 through the end of the semester I didn\'t have a single night off from either reading papers, watching lectures, doing the homework, or completing a project. The class tried to cram the entire semester (16 weeks) into the shortened summer semester (12) weeks. We had our assignments released in sets of 3 with 2 homeworks and 1 project. The projects were longer and required a write up. The homeworks were typically turned in online and we would get instant feedback.

They\'re a bit chatty though as I learned going back through them for the final trying to take notes. I liked the blend of theoretical and practical, but if math isn\'t your think, the theoretical part is pretty dense.\nThe workload is quite high in the summer. After the first week, there\'s a homework (6 of them), project (3), or test (the final) due every Monday. I. e., [hw, hw, project]*3 + final. There are probably 20+ hours of lectures and 20+ papers. I don\'t think anyone really read all the papers in depth and most fell behind on the videos. We were always struggling to keep up with graded assignments. The second project (lunar lander) also required reading unassigned material (almost everyone who was successful used DQN, which wasn\'t explicitly covered). You should aim to get the two homeworks done in a week and leave yourself two weeks for the project, if you\'re taking it in the summer. The extra weeks in a regular semester would make a very big difference in the pace. You could do one hw per week and have two weeks for the project.\nPersonally, I\'d prefer to see the course a little less project-oriented and split the final into a mid-term plus a final. That would force folks to stay up with the material and keep it up from being a semester of projects followed by a week of cramming. You could remove a project or make them a little easier. For instance, I would provide the soccer environment for project 3 and maybe give hints on some hyperparameters for the lunar lander project -- aspects of the projects that don\'t really have pedagogical value.\nIt\'s a lot of work, but you\'ll learn a lot and feel like you accomplished something.','Hard','Loved!','25 hours/week'),('CS-7642: Reinforcement Learning','Q23NRP1XGlaWhnFpeKtvW7rIBlw1','Loved this course!

You start with very small toy problems that can be solved directly using dynamic programming. From there, you gradually introduce the complications of the real world - infinite state spaces, stochastic reward functions, the inclusion of other agents that may be cooperative, adversarial, or indifferent, all the while learning of research from the past few decades resulting in tractable ways to induce human-or-better levels of performance in domains such as game play, autonomous drone flight, logistics scheduling, teaching robots to walk.\nThe idea is absurdly simple. Start with effectively random prediction of how well particular primitive actions might work and successively refine those predictions from whatever feedback you eventually receive, which may or may not be accurate feedback. Somehow this works, and this course gives you a mix of the mathematics to prove when and why it works, why it might work in practice even if you can\'t prove it works, and some of the practical research leading to hacks and tricks that make it work faster, better, or both.\nThe pros are the lectures and readings are engaging, insightful, among the best you\'ll get in this program.

I had just taken AI so was fairly comfortable with the concepts and NumPy already. There really isn\'t enough here to fill a semester, even a compressed summer semester.\nClass uses lame \"Piazza participation\" metric, which counts for 5% of the grade and caused the forum to be mostly filled with \"thanks\" and \"+1\" messages. I didn\'t really need to visit Piazza for help during the semester but went there every day just to click through the messages and occasionally answer a question so I wouldn\'t get a zero on participation. This policy also seems to benefit greatly the students who are asking the really embarrassing questions (e.g. \"how do I install the python? I have no programming\").\nOverall though, I can\'t complain too greatly. It was somewhat interesting and not too stressful.

This would be a good course to pair with another course since the time commitment is not as large per week as some other courses. However, communication between the professor and TAs regarding finalization of projects and content covered on exams was severely lacking. In many instances official communications did not finalize the projects until a few day before they were due.

This never happened and each was finalized just a few days before being due. Most assignments remained relatively unchanged, but the \"very challenging\" final project was finalized 5 days before it was due, and then changed again after being finalized to add a new section worth 15% of the grade. Needless to say, the instructor communication in this course was very poor. The TAs were great and grades were returned fastest of any of the 6 OMSCS courses I\'ve taken, but it was obvious they had extremely limited say in how things were run. Professor Balch was MIA for most of the course, leading to a lot of unnecessary confusion on Piazza. Combined with the new \"Piazza participation\" metric worth 5% of our grade, Piazza was difficult to meaningfully follow.\nThe projects were fairly easy overall. Some have YouTube videos with the professor walking you through a solution, while another took literally a few minutes to complete. There were 2 fewer projects in the Summer semester, though a portion of one was built into the final project. Two of the projects required writing reports, though neither was very intimidating due to the rubric spelling out exactly what to include.\nThere were 2 ProctorTrack exams of about equal, moderate-to-easy difficulty, though the final did include a few questions about The Big Short movie that were completely inappropriate/unrelated to this graduate-level course material.\nThere were 3 books (1 required, 2 optional), but I didn\'t use any of them and had no problem getting As on every assignment and exam.\nOverall, an easy class even for summer, made mildly frustrating only due to the professor\'s lack of engagement in making simple clarifications and some students\' lack of Piazza etiquette (exacerbated by the participation portion of our grade).\nCourse material is publicly available at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/Machine_Learning_for_Trading_Course','Easy','Liked','6 hours/week'),('CS-7646: Machine Learning for Trading','V71KBZGkGTgJOBSBxceObM7yck53','This was definitely a fun class.

This goes down as one of my favorite courses because of its high quality content on trading, and also because it helped us build \'applied\' machine learning skills. I\'ve taken ML courses at GT and CMU before, so I didn\'t come here to learn about ML as first-timer. I was planning on taking this course to do some applied machine learning and work with stuff like Pandas, numpy and I should say that I wasn\'t disappointed at all!\nThis course also served as a great introduction to trading. In fact, I\'ve been inspired to trade using Robinhood on the side. But that\'s a story for another day. Now, there were a few things that I disliked about the course and that doesn\'t have anything to do with the content:\n1) How it was run - I thought it was a mess. Frankly, TAs and the Prof. were kind of absent from Piazza. This might not be entirely a bad thing. But at some point I hoped that they intervened and confirmed a few things - such as grading questions, deadlines, rubric. I would like to thank my peers on piazza who helped people debug stuff, write test cases, and also posted strategies on tackling assignments. Yay crowdsourcing!\n2) The way assignments were released - Why weren\'t they finalized until the last moment ( like <5 days before the deadline) ? I do agree the most changes were really minor, but I\'m highly uncomfortable doing old assignments with old information. This is a personal but I\'d like to bring it up - I delayed doing all my assignments (yes even strategy learner!) until they were finalized, cause I couldn\'t mentally prepare myself working with old stuff that might change.\n3) Wiki issues - Why even have a \"Summer 2018\" page if it isn\'t updated. Seriously, why couldn\'t 1 TA spend half a day at the beginning of the semester and update all the wiki information? Here\'s what I find on the wiki page, even now, when the course has completed:\n\"You are on the page for information specific to the summer 2018 session of this course.

The lectures were pretty good, although both textbooks were totally unnecessary.\nI have two main complaints. The exams were trivial to the point of meaningless. There were questions on a movie that we were asked to watch (The Big Short) that you could have got the answers to by watching the trailer (they weren\'t financial questions either). The other questions were related to the material, but if you cram the relevant lectures in for a few hours before taking the exam, you\'re guaranteed to get a 90 or above (unless you just can\'t remember simple facts - little to no math required).\nSecondly, although this clearly wasn\'t the first time this course had been run throughout the summer, it may as well have been. Projects weren\'t finalized (or available on Canvas) until the last minute, and the final (hardest) project was still having fairly major tweaks right up until the weekend before it was due.\nLuckily, this didn\'t affect me because I\'m lazy and had barely started it at that point, but others were not happy.\nIn short, this is an easy course if you keep your wits about you. You\'ll likely have more difficulty keeping up with the changing requirements than you will with the actual material. So yeah - a fairly realistic preparation for real work in that sense.\nOverall, I recommend it, but you may not get as much out of it as you would hope.\nAdditionally, some of the TAs were really unhelpful to the point of antagonism.

The first two were almost nothing; they can barely be classified as projects. But it makes sense because they\'re supposed to serve as introductions. All of the projects were very interesting and fun to do. I have no previous ML experience (except for some basic boosting/bagging from CV but that was hardly a decent exposure, as much as I enjoyed CV) and that didn\'t hurt me in this class at all. It was so cool in the final project to program a trading system based on machine learning and look at the results. Code is tested on real stock data from real companies with some made up companies thrown in every now and then.\nAll of the project info is available ahead of time (see the link above) with the caveat that everything is in \"draft mode\" at first and will be \"finalized\" later. For some reason this was a huge problem for some people in the course. They refused to start until the project was finalized, which is kind of stupid on their part. We were told repeatedly not to do that and that any changes made would be minimal. The biggest change that I remember is in the second project. We had to optimize something different from the previous semester\'s students. Aside from that I think one or two other projects had a minor change and all the others had literally no change. People blew this draft mode thing way, way out of proportion.\nThere is a proctored midterm and a proctored final. Both are closed everything. The final is not cumulative. The midterm was extremely easy and was almost a regurgitation of previous midterms. It sounded like that won\'t always be the case.\n3 textbooks. One is required and is co-written by the professor. It\'s fairly cheap (especially for a textbook) and is a pretty good read. You\'ll definitely want it for the midterm at least. The other two books are Python for Finance by Hilpisch and the ML book by Mitchell. I can\'t remember if those two were actually required, but I didn\'t find them completely necessary. The lectures were enough.\nIt\'s often said that a finance background is helpful for this course. I think what people mean is a trading background, not a finance one. I have almost no finance background but I do have a relatively extensive trading background, and that helped a lot. I think manual_strategy would be the most difficult for people with no trading background since it requires an understanding of technical analysis and indicators. This stuff isn\'t too difficult, but it is a lot to learn on top of everything else if you\'re new to it.\nThat\'s kind of true of the course in general. It\'s not that this material is difficult, it\'s just that there is sometimes a lot of work in a short timespan. If you have a good background in Python or trading then it\'ll be less work, of course.\nThis is a good first class if you can get in your first semester.

For the midterm, there are crowd sourced question banks whose intentions are to make sure you actually understood the various parts of the course. If you have gone through them all and figured out the basics behind them, the midterm should be simple enough though it is closed book and proctored.\nThe final does not have a question bank, but the same methodology of going through your videos and material should make it simple enough.\nParting words\nThe last three assignments as noted as indeed challenging and equivalently given two weeks to complete. You can even start them on the first day though there might be tiny edits to the grading script at a later point.\nBut this is one of the best constructed courses and if you have some background in python, should be simple to pick up and any insights in finance would be an added booster.\n_Note: Though the course is constructed exceptionally well, it is not an easy A and you would still need to put in the hours required.

Unfortunately, this is a Finance class under the guise of a \"Machine Learning\" class. I put Machine Learning in quotes, because even Andrew Ng\'s outdated, free Coursera class provides a better introduction to ML compared to this one. By the way, there is zero mathematical background required for what is taught in this course, which is disappointing. If you compare the curriculum to Stanford/UC Berkeley/MIT, you will see that they are miles apart.\nWhat You\'ll Learn\nYou will implement: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Trees, Bagging/Boosting, and Q-learning. The rest of the course is about finance, with some Python syntax thrown into the mix. In addition, this course doesn\'t feel like a master\'s level class due to the amount of hand-holding it does (step by step instructions on what to do, you just need to convert it into Python syntax).\nPositives\nThe videos for this course are well-done, are interesting and are directly tied to the projects, unlike other classes.

If you\'re new to ML, Technical Analysis, or Python, this is an excellent first course. While the material effectively covers material sufficient for an introduction, you are free to take your learning further. For example, when learning about Reinforcement Learning, you can simply watch the course videos, or you can supplement your learning by reading the relevant sections from Suttons\' book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction and the videos from the OMSCS Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning courses. The approach you take, combined with the skills you begin with, will determine how much time you spend on the course.\nPROJECTS AND EXAMS\nThe projects build upon one another, so if you get something wrong it is critical that you go back and fix it. Also, beginning projects early is extremely useful, because some projects require experimentations and papers. I was surprised at how a few students would appear on Piazza or Slack a few days before the project was due proclaiming that they had not started the assignment and was asking how long it would take to complete. Again, the approach you take will determine how much you get from the class.\nENGAGEMENT\nI found the unofficial Slack community the most active - 24/7, especially in the days leading up to a project\'s due date or an exam. In many cases, students would answer questions in minutes or hours. Piazza was also useful, where some TAs were very active. Although, unlike Slack, answers from TAs or the professor ranged from minutes to days. I found my TA quite good and he would pull in other TAs when he couldn\'t provide a definitive answer. The professor was active on Piazza for the first half of the course, but was sparsely present during the second. Fortunately, the course proceeded smoothly with the head TA (who has previously taught the course) and other TAs actively participating.\nTIPS\nBegin projects early\nRead a few research papers so that you can write your reports in a similar style\nView the course as an introduction and feel free to go as deep as your interest takes you','Medium','Loved!','20 hours/week'),('CS-7646: Machine Learning for Trading','dZuzlRcB54gRTbXQ9UdT7XzS9wo2','This is an awesome course if you want to learn about Trading concepts.

It\'s a great starter course, as it isn\'t too difficult, but beware that the difficulty does ramp up towards the end of the course (though it still doesn\'t get exceptionally difficult) so don\'t let the first half fool you into thinking the second half is just as easy. Lecture material is very interesting, essentially being split into half-financial and half-intro to machine learning.\nThe projects all build upon one another in some way, so it\'s advisable to spend a sufficient amount of time making sure each one is done properly. You can work ahead, as all project descriptions and legacy code are available on the class website, BUT, the projects may change slightly closer to release so keep that in mind when you work ahead. DO NOT wait until projects are finalized before you start working on them, despite the chance some slight tweaks may be made to projects up to the week before it is due, start them as soon as you can. This is especially true with all of the projects starting from and including assess_learners.\nI would suggest making sure your marketsim project works perfectly when you get there. The most time consuming projects are assess_learners, manual_strategy and strategy_learner, with the latter two using your marketsim code, so make sure to allocate enough time to work on these when you get there. Also, for manual_strategy you will have to do some research into stock price indicators, and this project is used as a comparison for strategy_learner so it\'s good to choose these indicators wisely based on this research.\nThere are two proctored exams, one mid-term and one non-cumulative final exam. Questions aren\'t difficult as long as you review all of the material, watch all of the required additional videos (e.g., The Big Short), and go over the practice questions/previous term exams where possible.\nAll-in-all, the material is interesting, the projects are overall well-structured and utilize the material conveyed in lecture, and often even have instructional videos to help guide you through some of the more involved projects.

Another big portion of the course is getting insight on hedge funds, and other types of funds, and how they try to use mathematical equations and fundamental and technical analysis to find ways to beat the market. A final portion of the class is learning about basic ML algorithms such as Q-learners and Random forests, and gaining insight on how they can be used to make trading decisions. For many of the projects you have to write reports that are worth a significant portion of the project grade, and you can even get 1 or 2 extra credit points on a report if you put in the time to thoroughly analyze your results. I enjoyed how the online students were lumped together with the on campus students. My biggest complaint is there are a lot of details in the instructions that are easy to miss but can impact your grade on a project quite a bit, so always read the directions carefully.

It\'s not horrible but don\'t go in thinking it\'s one of the easiest courses in the program, it\'s not. There\'s a lot of good in the course but it currently suffers from poor execution and a lack of communication making the course way more stressful than it needs to be.\nThe lecture material is good, the assignments themselves are relevant and have the right level of challenge. Unfortunately most of the assignments were not released when they were expected to be. Assignments would be released in \"beta\" form a few days or even a week after we were expected to start them. and then sometimes not \"finalized\" until a few days before the assignment was due. This is troublesome because some of these assignments do need the full allotted time to work on them, and if you waited until an assignment was \"finalized\" you would pretty much guarantee that you don\'t have enough time to finish the assignment. This wouldn\'t be as bad if it were minor tweaks being made, but the \"beta\" version was typically just the previous semesters assignment and there was no clear communication on what changed with each iteration of the assignment so you are left analyzing every line of the assignment over and over to make sure you don\'t miss some gotcha that could cause you to lose substantial points.\nThis is my 9th OMSCS course and this course in its current form isn\'t very friendly to OMSCS students who typically have full-time jobs and other responsibilities outside of school. In addition to the above issues, assignments also were not open for submission until a day or two before the due date in many cases. So even if you had worked ahead, you still would need to plan around having an internet connection and submitting your assignment the day it was due. There were also random participation checks on the forums, punishing students who didn\'t check every day. In general it is structured in a way that prevented students planning around their life, and instead they must plan their life around the course. Most OMSCS courses I\'ve taken have been more flexible in this regard. Students who suggested changes to the course to improve it were met with snarky comments from the professor on the forums.\nIn general I can\'t recommend the course in its current form unless your willing to deal with the above headaches.

I rated it medium because really most of the projects took me around 6 hours to complete. Which I really don\'t think is bad. There were really only two projects that took around 8-10 hours to complete so in the end I rated it medium because most of the projects were. On average with assignments and lectures (plus the occasional reading), I would say it took me around 12 hours a week. That\'s on the high side again given that homework is due usually every other week. That being said here\'s the review. The course is really split into two sections. The front half is a lot of stock and market information with hands on Python assignments to supplement the learning. The latter half of the course is more machine learning in conjunction with Python and stock and finances. You don\'t need to be an experience python user to take this course. Though I did have experience using the Python libraries and Python is a language I program in every day so it will certainly help. Also, you don\'t have to be a stock expert. The lectures are straightforward an well laid out in nice manageable chunks. In fact most were 1 hour lectures I could easily do during my lunch if I wanted. The profession is very knowledgeable, funny, and a good presenter; you\'ll enjoy watching the lectures. This class really glances over a few machine learning algorithms and you\'ll program a few but I wouldn\'t say it\'s a full deep dive into Machine Learning. In fact it\'s really about using algorithms to trade stocks and manage portfolios. This of course makes it solid intro class. There were of course some drawbacks. Communications throughout the semester was terrible. Reddit was used instead of Piazza for this semester which I think threw a lot of non-reddit users through a loop. I happen to use it often but it made the threads really noisy and messy with people asking numerous redundant questions and not putting comments in the right threads. Additionally, communication from the professor was far and few between. Assignment \"updates\" or comments about questions in the reddit threads (which could easily grow in the few thousands) were fair game for requirements on assignments (even if not listed on the rubric). Assignments were hardly finalized until a 3-5 days before their due date and portals to submit were often times opened days before they were actually due. My TA was impossible to get ahold of throughout the semester. The assignments tended to have subtle but time consuming changes that needed to happen each week (one week give the output in this dataframe and the next is needs to be a series or another datatype). This wouldn\'t be bad overall if two things happened. 1. There was a blip or sample of what the output should look like. 2. Each week you weren\'t forced to retool your other classes and functions to accommodate the returns to be some new data type for the input of a new function. Overall, the factors above speak for themselves.

Optional \"difficult\" extra credit assignments have become full fledged assignments.\nThe class is great overall. My favorite aspect was the implementation of learning algorithms. I took RL and ML beforehand, but they were more theory based or had you use libraries. I felt like this refined some of my ML knowledge. I didn\'t know much about finance or the stock market coming in, so I appreciated taking that away from the class as well.\nGetting a good grade is another story. There is no curve, and I could see it being easy to mess up one assignment and totally kill any hope of you getting an A or B. Thus in order to succeed, you have to come at it in full-force.

There was certainly a learning curve in all three areas but the course did a good job of introducing the material so that even a newbie like me could catch on. The lectures on Udacity are well done. The assignments are solid and teach you a lot (be careful, often they build on each other so you can\'t just skip one and think you\'ll be fine).\nI had two issues with the course - 1) assignments weren\'t finalized until a week (sometimes less) before the due date. The professor would say \"you can use the old version to get started, not much will change\" but both times I did that I had a few hours of rework once the final version was released. I am not sure why a course that\'s as mature as ML4T can\'t get assignments finalized sooner, my three previous classes released everything well before the due dates. 2) Reddit was not a good forum for the course. My guess is that anonymity was a factor, some students were downright rude to one another. Other students asked really simple questions that were answered clearly in the assignment or syllabus. I wonder if having your real name tied to the post would have reduced some of that. Also, the threads got too long. I had two questions that never got answered (slack was helpful when that happened). Other times replies would go on the wrong thread and it was confusing to read. I have nothing against reddit, but it didn\'t seem a good fit for this course.\nAs for workload, some weeks I put in only a few hours, other weeks were more like 20 hours when a project was due. I was learning Python while doing the projects, so that may be higher than normal. Agreed with other comments that the midterm was tough to finish (I finished with maybe a minute left, and I\'m normally a great test-taker). I finished the final with plenty of time, but several questions were ridiculously unconnected to course content.\nFinally, the tone of the class was a bit off to me. Some of the professor\'s responses on reddit were rude. I\'ve taken other classes in the program where I felt like the TAs and professor really cared about the students and their learning.

For example, the course started a few days late, project requirements sometimes weren\'t \"finalized\" until a few days before the due date, important clarifications of project expectations were sometimes contained in a single post buried in the Reddit megathreads that were hundreds of posts deep, messages to the class were infrequent or incomplete, it was often impossible to submit a project to T-Square until two days before the due date, wording of exam questions was often vague, and the checks for course participation were essentially abandoned halfway through the course.\n--There was very little feedback on projects.\n--The grading was slow for some of the auto-graded projects and participation quizzes.\n--It was a challenge to search the Reddit megathreads that were often several hundred comments deep.\n--Professor Balch\'s tone on Reddit sometimes didn\'t come across as very encouraging.\n--Some of the additional assigned shows or movies (e.g. The Big Short) weren\'t at all relevant to machine learning.\n--The answer key used to score the final exam had two incorrect answers (Professor Balch eventually acknowledged one mistake, but stood behind the other even though it directly contradicted an assigned video).\n--Professor Balch\'s frequent references to Monty Python are distracting and could be confusing to those that aren\'t native English speakers.','Easy','Liked','10 hours/week'),('CS-7646: Machine Learning for Trading','yhVk2rIbSWd0XVFcMZR5bGqadqm2','Interesting class.

Even with that modification, it was still the case that the workload was substantially more in the last month, so I\'d advise future students to knock out all the lecture material in the first half of the semester. Conveniently, draft versions of all projects are available from the start of the semester, so I was able to work way ahead and not feel overwhelmed when April rolled around.

I believe the intent was to make enough changes to prevent plagiarism from previous iterations of the course.

For me, because I have already some experience on Python and ML but have no finance background at all, the second part is difficult for me. But as long as you watch the videos and do some reading, there is no problem. If you have no background in finance or ML at all, ML4T is a good choice for an introduction.\nThus, I would recommend taking ML4T before ML7641 because ML4T doesn\'t require a deep understanding of ML or math. It can help you get familiar with numpy and pandas, have a big picture about ML and RL, and understand its applications in stocks. If you want to go further, you can learn more in ML7641 and RL7642.\nThe course is overall well scheduled. I can prepare things ahead and avoid big conflicts with my full-time job. But if you want to start an assignment very early (2 weeks ahead), be aware that the instructor will change the rubric a week (sometimes 3 or 4 days) before the deadline of the assignment. These changes would not ruin the framework or design of your codes. But you need to use your codes on different data and generate different results or graphs according to the new rubric. I think he did this to avoid plagiarism from previous assignments.\nThe grading of assignments is exactly based on the rubric. The rubric is overall clear to me. But you do need to spend some time to understand the rubric correctly. For me, Piazza is a great resource. The instructor, TAs and students are very responsive on Piazza. Yes, there are a LOT of posts on Piazza, and a lot of duplicate posts. But it doesn\'t bother me. It \"reinforces\" me to learn better by looking at other folks\' questions.','Easy','Liked','10 hours/week'),('CS-7646: Machine Learning for Trading','qnCNIGp3FIMio5RtAZyNTOPB7Rd2','This was my sixth course in the program.

The interesting thing about this class compared to any other I have taken was that everything builds on top of what you have previously done. You will insert code you wrote at the beginning of the course into the final assignments. One piece of advice I will give is to make sure everything you write is commented correctly and modular enough to be copy/pasted into another file as you will do this almost every week.\nOne thing I did hate in the course was the midterm. It was very difficult (I got a high C. ) The reason for this is that half questions come right out of Professor Balch\'s book, and the other half are programming questions. (ex. What is the output of dFTrading[:, 1, \'IBM\']) I have never in my life taken a programming test on paper like this. I can figure that kind of stuff out all day long on a computer but struggled to do it in a multiple choice exam.\nOverall I really did like the class.

They also expect you to copy-paste code from your old assignment file into the next source file they expect you to make.

The other issue here is they\'re revamping the assignments on the go from what they used to be in the Coursera course, presumably to make them more challenging for grad students qualified to study at Georgia Tech, rather than the 10, 000 who used to take the course for free every few months, but they\'re not releasing them on-time and we\'ve ended up with a great deal of dead time between finishing something and having nothing else to work on.

Yes, it was the first semester this was offered, so I expected it to be imperfect and feel the students have had grace for that. Going into the semester, I was thinking that between the two brand new courses I was taking, this would be the more organized b/c the instructor had taught this multiple semesters, already had a class website, and had an environment already setup. Another of the disappointments I have had are that many of the final projects have been filled with coding the underlying ML algorithms from scratch rather than actually applying ML to the quantitative finance domain. It seemed that ML knowledge was prerequisite for the course, so I therefore thought that\'s what the course was about. I\'d expect some of this implementation of the basic workhorse algorithms in ML to be in an ML class... kind of like our implementation requirements of 7641. With that mindset, it seemed rather frustrating to receive project assignments approx. 1 week prior to the due date that were requiring this type of development... and again, not necessarily tied-to the trading / computational finance domain.

The class seems to be designed from the ground up to scale for being online, and it makes a huge difference. I agree with other reviews that this course comes more from an engineering perspective than a science perspective. Principles are taught in class and they are useful in the projects, but the projects will throw some real-world curveballs at you, so you need to do some real-world problem solving, and find some workable heuristics to use with the principles. And if you find a \'cheap\' solution that doesn\'t even use the class material, that\'s okay - the rule here is if it works, it\'s not stupid! That\'s a delightful approach; without it, students sometimes end up having to play \"guess what the instruct is expecting you to think\".','Medium','Loved!','10 hours/week'),('CS-8803-001: AI for Robotics','vfBawONILeYqh4y4Hr8hSSIPq722','I enjoyed this class, overall. It wasn\'t super difficult, but the projects were sufficiently challenging and engaging. The runaway robot project can be tough without prior experience with Kalman/particle filters (it helps having already taken CV, since one of the projects in there uses these filters). And the final project (project 2 for the summer course) was definitely a big challenge - one that combined most of the topics learned in the class - but was extremely rewarding at the end.\nI wish the course also included the SLAM project and more content from that area, but I understand the difficulty in cramming more material in a shorter window. I feel like the course could be reworked to include this if certain aspects of the prior projects were modified.\nEither way, I\'d recommend taking this course if you\'re interested in robotics and automation. It\'s not insanely in-depth, but the projects are engaging, and the topics are interesting.\nAlso, I think this often gets recommended as a potential first course. I actually would not recommend taking this first, unless you are very confident in your Python/Numpy/linear algebra skills. I think getting some more experience in those areas goes a long way with the projects in this class.','Medium','Liked','10 hours/week'),('CS-8803-001: AI for Robotics','WI6Lt9NmqYZAO9vyNJKFRgf8JQ32','AI4R was a great class! It was a suitable option for summer session, as the third project, which is definitely a difficult and time consuming one, was dropped. There were opportunities for extra credit as well, which was great if you were wanting to ensure you don\'t just miss out on a grade by a percent or two.\nThe lectures are well done, but you will have to do a lot of extra reading to supplement the videos. It\'s not too bad, but I can understand if people are put off by this fact, especially if they\'re not expecting it. The videos do a good job of covering the foundations and touch on some of the more advanced details, but you will likely have to read some papers or other resources to get a handle on more advanced techniques and implementation of these techniques.\nThe projects are fairly well defined; we had two mini-projects, and two full projects. The full projects were definitely time consuming, so I would suggest starting on them soon after release. Even if it\'s just playing around with different ideas and trying different approaches, it will help you get a handle on how the problems are set up and how you should be tackling them. The nice thing about the projects is that they\'re fairly open-ended in terms of implementation, as you can choose from a few viable algorithms or approaches to solve the problems.\nAssignments are your answers to the quizzes in the Udacity videos. You also have to upload your code and answers to ensure nothing gets lost in case Udacity loses your answers on their end. These were easy and basically a free 30%.\nTAs were excellent; they were extremely responsive and informative. Assignment and project grades were given back VERY fast, sometimes in the same day.\nAll-in-all, it was a well-run class and I would highly recommend. If you want to learn SLAM, which is an important and very powerful algorithm for robot localization and mapping, to the fullest extent the class can offer, I would advise taking this during the regular term so you don\'t miss out on project 3. Be warned that it IS very difficult, however. So if you don\'t mind missing out on this last project, this class is a decent choice for summer.

Later strategies were interesting. The projects are a whole other beast as they test much more than what is covered in lecture. Compared to other courses such as Computational Photography or Computer Vision I would say the projects are \'easier\' conceptually but \'significantly less straightforward\' to implement.\nEg a project which was basically \'implement particle filters\' which I\'ve implemented at least 3 times before took 10x as much time to finish as in other classes. This is due to a lack of scaffolding provided compared to other courses (you have to integrate your code and write almost everything that\'s not related to the core algorithm). I will say they did cover how to implement particle filters quite well. Just that the bulk of your time in the projects is not spent on the core algorithms the lectures cover.\nThe projects build on one another so if you didn\'t manage to get earlier projects be ready to devote significant time on later projects catching up. Lastly the grades are all or nothing (very much like real life) unlike other courses which test each part of the project separately.\nIf you are not familiar with the concepts taught in this class you will struggle with having enough time to implement them. That being said the lectures do cover the material quite well. It\'s just due to the all or nothing nature it\'ll be hard for you to know whether it is a bug with the algorithms or an integration bug somewhere else.\nSemi extra credit in terms of additional projects/challenges was offered, but I don\'t consider them realistic given the time devoted to core projects.\nI would NOT recommend this to new students to the program. For the final project around 1/3 of the students got 0% on the grade on a piazza poll and less than 1/2 got >50% due to the all or nothing nature.\nTip for project 3: Ignore almost everything that is suggested for this project by lecture. The biggest challenge is not related to what the project seems to want to test you on at all. If you waste your time on the algorithm covered in lecture. You won\'t have time to work on the actual time consuming part of the project. You won\'t even need anything you implemented in Project 2 or Project 1B. Just use the strategy from Project 1A to deal with inputs and focus on the real challenge. Learned this the hard way when I ran out of time and discovered my optimized implementation wasn\'t even needed or used in the final solution. Also for the mini project before hand, there\'s a significantly simpler alternative that\'s much easier than the suggested algorithm.

That enthusiasm didn\'t just come through in the lectures, but in the three office hours he gave throughout the semester. These office hours were interesting too, and he took questions from students ranging from project implementation details to research and industry topics. Pretty cool.\nDr Summet\'s office hours were very useful, and he held them every week. He was also very involved on Piazza and personally answered many student questions.\nThe projects are fun. The course doesn\'t cover that many topics, but you will become an expert in A*/DP path planning, Kalman/Particle filters, and PID control. When/if you finish the projects, you\'ll feel proud. And if you\'re like me, you\'ll replay the Python scripts over and over once you\'re done just to watch what you made.\nIn my semester, the students on Piazza were valuable and supportive.\nThere were no tests, and the homework answers were given for free (they still counted towards your grade). No group projects. You\'ll have many weeks to prepare for most of the projects.\nNegatives\nThe projects really seem all-or-nothing. They use an automated grader to score your projects, and you\'ll probably have to spend double digit hours just to maybe get a tiny amount of points from the sample grader. The real test cases they will grade with are not given in advance, but sample cases are provided that closely match. Don\'t underestimate the time commitment you\'ll need for those projects. We had a week extension on the last project, and still many people reported that they could not get any points on their test runs before having to turn it in.\nTips\nPython is heavily used, and it will be valuable if you\'re already familiar with it. Start the projects right when they become available. Try to do the projects in stages, like making sure you have basic functionality before meeting the full requirements.\nI wouldn\'t go so far to say that the lectures didn\'t cover what you need for the projects (like others have stated). The core of my logic for every project was solely stuff we learned in class. That being said, there are implementation details that will take a while to work out, and parameters that will need to be heavily tuned.

Beginning of class and up to lesson 3 it\'s a breeze and less hours is ok but after that the lessons are comprehensive and requires more work to understand. Few projects are all or nothing. 0 score in one project can push the grade downward (A to B or B to C). Python programming basic level is ok as many helpful code (copyright) are given to use in your implementation.

I don\'t have formal CS educational background or software engineering working experience. I have been programming with Python for a year or so to prepare for the application of OMSCS. I have taken college maths classes (which I dont think is used in this course).\nAbout the class materials: The lectures are very interesting and well structured. Probably not wide/deep enough. But the research challenge arranged by the instructor provided good opportunities for self-exploration and learning from each other. It is a pity that I did not spend much time on it. The hardware challenge also seems very interesting. I am not a hardware person myself but the things classmates posts are really impressive.\nAbout the instructor: The instructor Jay is very nice and effective. He almost answered/hinted every question on piazza. In a few cases when I twisted my wording to hide my stupidity when asking questions, he seemed to understand my intention and hinted on my confusion directly. I really appreciate his efforts in running this class well.\nAbout the projects: Project 3 is challenging. There are too many details that can mess things up. I decided to give it up to get a B but the deadline was extended. So I \"had to\" work on it for another week and eventually I scored 6 out of 10 test cases and managed to get a A. (I lost 4 points because my solution was not designed to deal with certain situations due to lack of energy).\nMy lesson from project 3 is\n1) you need to really understand what SLAM is doing exactly in each step (same for the other algorithms taught in the class) . Only after that you can correctly modify the implementation. It seems a lot of classmates claimed that there is bug in the SLAM code. But it did work, at least for some other classmates and me.\n2) read and participate in the discussions on piazza. I had to make numerous decisions for the project and I did not have the time/patient to try them out. For learning purposes I listed the pros and cons for my options but most of my decisions are based on the comments from the instructors and other classmates. Sometimes even \'typing\' the question helped me figure out the answer immediately. I heard from the instructor that it is called \"Rubberduck debugging\".\nFirst class? If you know python and know how to plan to \"solve a problem\" and execute your plan, I think you should be fine.

The class is not time consuming with the exception of the projects. There are six problems sets (if I don\'t recall incorrectly), and these are easy to complete because you have the solution available to you and a video that walks you through the code. For the projects, a mini project in addition to three main projects will be given. The projects are very time consuming. In my opinion, this turns out to be this way because the lectures and material presented in class are effective in showing basic concepts for this class, but fail to expand more into each of those basic concepts to make such material meaningful to solving the projects. Don\'t get me wrong. Even with the right background, the projects would be hard and time consuming.\nGrading of these projects strictly depends on your code being able to pass test cases. If you don\'t pass any of the test cases, you don\'t get any marks. It doesn\'t matter if you have a 1000 line code. That being said, do well in the mini project, project 1 and 2. These projects are doable, and you can get them done in a week or less except for project 2. Spend more time on that one because part b of this project becomes challenging and is code that you can use for project 3. The deadline for dropping classes is right around the same time project 2 is given, so if you flunk project 2 you will not be able to drop the class. It would be better if you could complete project 2 before the drop deadline to be able to better gauge your success in the class. This is something future students should recommend. Project 3 is the hardest. Spend two weeks or more on it. The connection between project 3 and the class material is the least apparent, so you will spend more time figuring out how to proceed with your implementation. Chances are that you will reuse your code from project 2 part b.\nThe nice part is that project previews in Piazza usually come a week prior to the release of the projects in t-square. This allows you to work ahead, which helps with organization and project time allocation. So, as soon as you get the project preview, start working on the project.\nAs a summary, my recommendation is to 1) Do well in the mini project, project 1 and project 2 to be successful and 2) organize yourself to allocate enough time for each project, and 3) start working on the projects as soon as the project previews become available.','Hard','Neutral','15 hours/week'),('CS-8803-001: AI for Robotics','zrbRklzp74ZdjXXqi32cYaP8ik22','Interesting but not particularly challenging class.

It had a world renown professor, the head of google\'s self driving cars, who knows his stuff, explains complex topics in intuitive ways, is enthusiastic and has a sense of humor. The TAs are great, on top of every thread. And if you\'re into this sort of thing, it is E.A.S.Y. The answers are given! You can literally just cut and paste code from the answers page and put it in. The TAs are ok with this. The lectures are short, and there is no complex mathematics anywhere that you find in many other OMSCS courses (it\'s all simple trigonometry). This is the best course ever, and the perfect introduction to OMSCS. If you are just starting your masters, you want this course.\nMy only complaint is it was too easy. Now, a lot of other reviews say it was hard, so hard they dropped out, and there was too much math. Let me address this. First, If they think there was too much math here, or it was hard, they obviously haven\'t taken a truly hard class, like Machine Learning, Graduate Algorithms, AI, Computer Vision, etc etc. If they found this hard, I don\'t see how they would be able to graduate. There is NO math required to get an A (again, you can just cut-and-paste answers).\nThe reason people think it is hard is because they shoot themselves in the foot. They did not ask \'is there an easier way to do this?\'. They did not read the requirements carefully, or assumed too much. For example, for the projects, you are asked to predict the next location of a robot. The lectures are about Kalman filters, and so many people naturally assumed you should be using a Kalman Filter. But see, that is not anywhere in the assignment. Why even bother, when it\'s such a simple solution? The robot is moving a fixed distance at a fixed angle. SImple trigonometry will give you the answer. The next assignment, the measurements are noisy, and these people again, for whatever reason, shoot themselves in the foot and try to use a Kalman filter. It\'s non-linear noisy movement, so they try to implement the Extended Kalman Filter. Again, there is no need to do that! The EKF isn\'t even mentioned! There were posts after posts on the Extended Kalman Filter, pages and pages devoted to the topic, for absolutely no reason. Why do unneccessary work like \'calculating the determinate of the Jacobian Matrix\'? I have no idea. The only assignments you\'re not given the answers to are the 3 projects. There are people reporting 100+ hours on the third project alone. I handed it in within 3 days, and got a 100%. These people are trying to do it the hard way, like calculate probabilities for distant objects, trying to implement difficult algorithms like graph slam, all for no reason. Sure, all those things were suggested in the descriptions, and that\'s what the lectures are about, so kudos to you if you wanted to go that route. But, and I can\'t emphasize this enough, there is no need for any of that. There\'s no move limit, you can ram into as many walls as you like - that means you can design the most inefficent algorithm you want. You can randomly carom your robot about the screen and, while slow and ugly, will eventually traverse the entire warehouse. I can mathematically prove it if you want. Point is, if you\'re willing to solve problems in your own way, and not the complicated way, you\'ll do just fine in this class.

One reason I love this course is that it tells the most important concepts in robotics in the simplest way.

The homework are pretty easy and solutions are given to you so they give you a very good opportunity to practice your programming skills in python. Although you can get free 30% from the homework assignments, the projects are not so easy. Project 2 and Project 3 each took me more than 600 lines of code. They are not easy, but not that hard. As others said, even if you cannot solve the problem with the concepts from the lectures, you can solve them using geometrically solutions.

However there is a very significant gap between the lectures and projects and that causes real problems. I would say the lectures are at advanced high-school level, but you need a much better graduate level understanding of the material to be able to do the projects. You are going to need to spend a lot of time researching the topics on your own. Over the summer, this is a big problem. The lectures and homeworks don\'t require that much time - about 10 hrs/week when you have them (6 weeks of lectures) - but beware! The projects are very large. I carefully timed my workload and people are really lowballing it in their estimates. My average time per week (over the summer) was 27 hours; I did some of the hardware and research challenges but not all. But the time is all loaded in the projects. I spent almost 230 hours on the 3 projects combined! And I was part of a large team that worked diligently on Project 3. I expect to get an A, but with the projects there is a real limit to how much time you can take out and still have them work. The difference between A and B is optimization, but the projects have to work in the first place and there is a very real danger you will not be able to get them working in the time you have if you are doing this class over the summer and have other demands (like, say, a job). They start hard (compared to what you know) and get progressively harder. I really struggled to get Project 1 working properly. Project 2 is straightforward but tedious (A*/dynamic programming) and probably there is too much of it; it belabors the point. Project 3 is just very hard, period - I had to really research it on my own and try lots of approaches that failed before one worked.

Essentially, there\'s the 6-week Udacity portion (which is great), then with no further instruction there are two more projects (which are beyond the scope of the lectures - although they\'ll tell you otherwise). Of course, you can solve the last two projects with just the knowledge gained from the lectures, but it\'s very difficult to do so. You\'ll have to do more unguided research than you expect. Despite reviews from past semesters rating this course as an easy one, I urge you not to expect this course to be easy, because it\'s not (unless you\'re already familiar with the math and robotics).\nMy advice: if you need this class for your specialization (like me) then you\'ll just have to go for it, however if you don\'t need it, I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend it, at least not during a short summer semester.

Part 5 of the project ended up being extra credit. The first 4 parts are doable with basic math and probability, but the point is to use what was learned in those first 3 lessons.\nProject 2 involved helping a robot find its way around a warehouse. Contrary to what others say, the 3 parts of this project directly correspond to lessons 4, 5, and 6. Part A was a breeze. Part B was not but some really awesome students shared their own test cases on Piazza. Instructors used some when grading. They helped me find serious flaws in my code and my project 2 grade was better because of it. Thank you, awesome students. Anyone who didn\'t use those test cases only has themselves to blame.

I believe the research challenges were new this semester and consisted of finding an article relevant to the Udacity content in Weeks 1 to 6 and writing a Piazza post about it. One research challenge was due at the end of each week. Hardware challenges consisted of creating an electronic project.\nThe research and hardware challenges were only counted towards a higher grade if you are at the borderline between grades (if you earn a B but you are very close to an A, if you do well in the challenges you will be pushed up to an A).\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had not done the research challenges, or at least spent a lot less time on them. Finding papers at the right level took a bit of time and writing about each research paper took more time than it deserved. My time would have been better spent progressing with the Udacity videos. This would have given me more time to do the Runaway Robot project and Final Project. Oh well, shoulda, woulda, coulda!\nI guess the same could be said about the hardware challenge but as I enjoyed playing around with electronics versus writing I don\'t regret doing those challenges. My advice for future students is unless you are quick or enjoy the challenges skip them and focus on the core work.\nLastly, I would like to comment on the grade distribution in these unofficial course surveys. The grade cut off for an A is 90% but in these course reviews 75% of people received an A so I suspect these reviews are not a true reflection of current grade distribution.','Hard','Liked','30 hours/week'),('CS-8803-001: AI for Robotics','H6JHNhWdM1Mtx9OAQuop3xS818C3','I did not enjoy this class.

The lectures were frustrating , skim in details and glossed over necessary mathematics to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. I spent many hours over them but was still not able to understand the maths. The TAs though active did not do anything to help you understand these concepts. The office hours with Dr Thrun were of no help either. I just felt that they are deliberately trying to hand over B’s and C’s to students. You can confirm that from grade distribution for Spring 2016 where only 48% people got an A as opposed to 80% in earlier semesters. I have no problem with getting a lower grade as long as the subject simulates my thinking and helps me understand the concept. I wasn’t able to grasp any concept taught in the class , as the projects did not require any application of the concepts. This course might have been tolerable in the past when 80 - 90% people got an A when the instructors understand that the material provided in this course is too superficial and graded accordingly. But instead of improving the quality of the course , they decided to add vigor by making testing harness hard and by ensuring that 50% people should get B or lower. If you miss one single test case , you will lose 10 - 12 points and then there is no coming back. (Hint : Please confirm for runway robot1 , which values can be negative. It will be obscurely defined and if you miss it you will be done. ) If you get lower marks in project 1 , promptly withdraw from this course.

The lectures were fun, although Professor Thrun\'s relentless encouragement seemed sarcastic at times. I certainly agree with other reviewers when they said certain concepts were only mentioned in passing before having to implement them in the next section, but since you could always look at the answer, it didn\'t seem like as much of a road block.\nThe rest of the class seemed like a disaster. Thrun\'s lack of interaction with the class, although understandable, was certainly a bummer. The TAs seemed like they were planning on dropping there interaction level from the start. Strict adherence to policy with little to no personal responsibility for actually nurturing understanding. They dangled an extra-credit-carrot for piazza posts, which is just stupid at a fundamental level. You have a torrent of answers from C students instead of just the normal overachievers; it made piazza pretty much unusable.\nThe pacing of the course is also completely out-of-whack. In the beginning it seems like you can just do a lecture a week and you will be fine, as they take only an hour or so. By the final lecture you are having to do additional research and re-watch videos in order to understand the concepts and they end up taking much longer.

The hexbug project was a group project and meant to be the hardest, however, you can use scikit learn to basically do it for you so it ends up being trivial. The warehouse robot project involved having a robot navigate a maze to locate packages. However, the robot is allowed to walk through walls so there is really no maze that needs to be navigated. Releasing a project in this state to students would never have happened at my previous college. The runaway robot project is fun, but the later parts are unconnected to the lectures.\nBy far the most annoying thing about this course is the number of errata in the materials.

I am a total noob, so everything is advanced to me... I guess it is how you make of it. The course gives you many opportunities to learn more advanced techniques, but you can complete the course satisfactorily (I guess) without doing so.

The problem sets are scored as all or nothing, but the answers are also provided so it seems to be just a matter of having tried or not tried. If you want to get more advanced, materials for advanced study are also provided, but it would not really hurt if you do not glance over them. It is easy to get complacent, until you get to the Runaway Robot and the Final Project, which are really challenging. You really needed to take a big leap, read a lot more and explore other possible algorithms to solve the problem.

Overall, I highly, highly recommend taking this course and recommend that other instructors use this course as a template when designing new courses!\nEDIT: While I still highly recommend this course, I wanted to make a note of the grading policy. There are 6 lectures, each of which has some programming assignments associated with it. The total points for all assignments is worth 24% of the class grade, without any partial credit per week. The runaway robot project is worth 36% of the class grade, with up to a 12% extra credit opportuniy for finishing part 5. Part 5 was pretty difficult (Professor Thrun admitted to giving up on it) and less than 10 students to my knowledge finished it.

Most teams perform not much better than random chance. We scored on the \'high side\' of that Gaussian curve, but my suspicion is it had little to do with coding and more the random initial state. There were a few teams that applied some sophisticated CV + machine learning that performed better, but that has more to do with those skills than the Robotics AI taught in this class.\nI would highly recommend that you take advantage of the opportunity to propose your own robotics project.

So you stop pushing commits to Git, because they keep changing your code, you end up doing all the work yourself, are accused of not being a team player, and then as time runs out they end up using your code in the end because you knew what you were talking about. This actually happened to me.\nIf you don\'t care about your grade, and can handle nonsensical feedback/scores, you will learn some practical stuff.

The projects use industry-standard compiler tools and algorithms, so you could easily apply the knowledge gained in this class elsewhere if you needed to.\nYou will (most likely) learn a LOT. It is impossible to make it through this class without deeply understanding the parts of the compiler you\'re supposed to implement (lexing, parsing, symbol table generation, semantic analysis, IR generation, register allocation, instruction selection), the abstractions used under the hood (regular languages, context-free languages, parse trees, attribute grammars, control flow graphs, SSA, live ranges, live webs, etc.).\nThe 4 written homeworks were relatively short, but very topical, and struck a good balance between reinforcing the practical things we had to know for the projects and complementing them with the theoretical things we learned in lectures.\nWhen you\'re done, you\'ll be happy you took it (if you were able to make it).\nBad:\nThe professor is uninvolved, and the TAs run the show. However, at least my semester, the TAs were distinctly unhelpful.\nAnswers on Piazza were vague; project descriptions were underspecified or flat out wrong (this is not an opinion - one of the requirements of the first project was provably impossible, and when I pointed this out to the TAs, they were unable to understand the issue, despite agreeing with me that it was impossible).\nIt turns out that compilers are extremely detailed, and those details are really important; expect to spend a lot of time looking for clarifications that may or may not be provided. We had to just make arbitrary decisions on a lot of issues, and document those decisions in our writeup.\nThe 2 projects are both group projects (3 person teams), and you must have the same group for each project (since project 2 builds on project 1).\nThe only allowed languages are Java and C++. Be very comfortable in at least one of them.\nThe projects are both large enough that you can afford to have 1 slacker, but not 2.\nThe projects are sizable enough (i.e. 10,000+ lines of code) that you will either learn/use good software engineering practices, or fail. Again, your group composition can make or break you.\nBoth projects are \"green field\" projects, meaning there is no starter code, no push in the right direction. This is a double-edged sword because it forces you to think about the design you want, but it\'s definitely less forgiving than it could be.\nOverall, this class wouldn\'t be that hard, if it weren\'t for the projects (which I hope get reworked).

So if you like reading and have time just read the textbook in order in advance.\nThe projects are group projects and require a lot of work that you need to start early, very early, do NOT leave them until the end, you need to work on them for the full month or so of time allotted.

The best approach is just to re-write the algorithm in code into you get the results you expect. The homework is very difficult because the questions are vague but expect precise answers. Fortunately, if you head my advice for dealing with the text book, you can use the same approach and produce code to solve your homework. You don\'t get credit for the code but it certainly make producing nice LaText and reduces the chance of you transliterating something in your process.

In the second phase, you perform register allocation and instruction selection and generate MIPS instructions. Although you learn code optimization, the grading emphasis is on correctness, not performance.\nThe project is coding-intensive. You can use either Java or C++ and are provided with a few default data structures that you may or may not use. Most of what you need you have to develop yourself.

This is the far better of the two course parts. The homework assignments and projects are well-defined and fairly straightforward, if divorced from the content of the lecture videos.\nI honestly did not even watch the course videos for the most part, and found them tangential at best to the tasks you\'re asked to complete. The actual videos are produced well enough but lack any kind of context or narrative thread, so it\'s very easy to just let it go in one ear and out the other without retaining anything. The Udacity course also commits an imho cardinal sin by embedding multiple videos on a single lesson section and consequently disabling auto-play (which goes back to the aforementioned lack of narrative thread). Ultimately though, as I noted before, this isn\'t a huge deal because the lecture videos aren\'t particularly useful -- in fact, the few instances when I did try to reference them to clarify something in an assignment I couldn\'t find anything pertinent.\nThe homework assignments varied quite a bit, starting with basically some short Q&A/essays on cyber-physical systems, then going into basically a homework assignment solving a physics 101 problem (calc-based physics 101, to be clear), and then some minor coding assignments in C around black-box testing and input-output feedback loops. The essays required a day or so of work to compile, but neither the physics quiz nor the coding assignments required more than a couple hours work.\nBoth projects involve commanding either one or a set of GRITSbots to accomplish a set of specified tasks, subject to a set of specified constraints, in a MATLAB Robotarium simulator. You also have the opportunity to run your code against live robots in the Robotarium for the first project, which is neat but also frustrating, because you\'re only allotted two attempts in the actual live environment, and will likely find that your robot does not behave live as advertised in the simulation. This is not an issue for grading though, as you are provided a data set to use if needed for the analysis portion of this project, and are graded for code based on the results of the sim and not the live result.\nBoth projects should be completable with a dedicated weekend of work.\nIf the entire course was just Dr. Feron\'s course, I would\'ve probably rated this class \"Neutral\" with an \"Easy\" difficulty. I don\'t feel like I really gained much from it, but the assignments were for the most part entertaining and it\'s elective hours.\nPart two is taught by Dr. Jérôme Hugues, who is effectively \"on-loan\" from the Institute for Space and Aeronautics Engineering, part of the Université Fédérale de Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées. He is highly credentialed and active in the CPS field. But don\'t for a second be fooled into thinking that implies he\'s effective as an instructor in this course.\nAs Dr. Hugues is French, there is a language barrier to be overcome for the predominantly Anglophone demographic of the OMSCS program. His lessons and assignments are of course delivered in English -- you don\'t need to learn French, of course -- but his spoken English is heavily accented and difficult to understand, and his written assignments often lack precision.\nWhereas the assignments for Dr. Feron\'s portion of the course were well-defined and had explicit questions and/or objectives, Dr. Hugues\' assignments were exclusively extraordinarily vague and open-ended questions, as though he\'s attempting a Socratic descent into teaching the material. That works great in an open classroom setting where students and mentor can collaborate on exploring the topic. It is not at all appropriate for a graded assignment for which you\'re only allowed one submission.\nAs another review noted -- and I don\'t know if this is just a cultural misunderstanding or actual personality -- Dr. Hugues can also be quite brusque when you attempt to ask for clarification. He often declines to answer questions outright, asserting that it\'s deliberately vague so that you can decide how best to answer (but how can I answer when I don\'t understand the query?).\nIt could just be that I am not a smart individual, and certainly some students in the class were able to complete his assignments, but for both of them I found myself completely lost and in the mindset of \"I understand the individual words you\'ve used, but I can\'t put them together into coherent entities that make sense in my brain.\" I\'ve spent days trying to dissect his project and still don\'t understand what it is I\'m intended to do. I suspect that, given Dr. Hugues\' background, he just assumes a lot of systems engineering background as common-sensible, which is probably a valid assumption at his home institution with his home target audience, but isn\'t valid in a computer science course that has, at best, only an informal prerequisite of anything of the sort. I sure as hell don\'t, and I\'m suffering mightily from it.\nIt is worth noting that Dr. Hugues\' portion of the course does not begin until after the drop date, so Dr. Feron\'s portion can easily lull you into a sense of false security about where you stand grade-wise. With a perfect score in the course going into drop day, I\'m now basically assuming zero credit on all of Dr. Hugues\' assignments and hoping I can perform well enough on the final (I think I can, since it is, I believe, prepared by Dr. Feron) to maintain a C.\nConsequently, for Dr. Hugues\' portion of the course I would rate \"Strongly Disliked\" and \"Very Hard\" in terms of difficulty: I have learned nothing and gained nothing but frustration from it. I do think that if you were able to surmount the language barrier, expand this to a full course on its own merit, and assume less in terms of prerequisite knowledge, this could be an effective course.

Understanding involves ability to read the provided code and also run experiments with the code. This might require exploring some external resources especially in C or Python in case you have minimal experience. The instructors are very helpful and held a weekly Q&A session (Saturday), though not many students participated to take advantage of the instructors availability.

The office hours were held on Saturday am which made them easy to attend. I learned a lot in the class as I have a fascination with autonomous system.

I enrolled for this course, knowing it\'d be difficult and that I needed to spend ample time on it, in order to grasp the material. I never had a formal intro to under-grad level algorithms prior to enrolling in this course.\nThe course covers in depth algorithms, ranging from Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, Graph algorithms, Linear programming, NP complete algorithms, various reductions to prove NP complete algorithms. This is a great course to develop algorithmic thinking, which may help you in technical interviews. And you only need to write pseudo-code, use algorithms as a black-box to solve specific problems and perform analysis of algorithms. So no coding except on the project. You only need to write less than 100 lines of code (take this with a grain of salt, I gave the number just as an idea) in total for the course\nI spent a lot of time playing catch up. For example, I didn\'t know how graphs are represented, basic algorithms for graph traversal/exploration, finding shortest path using Dijkstra\'s, Bellman-Ford algorithm etc. So, if you\'re in the same boat as me and are really interested in taking the course, I\'d suggest taking only this course, and maybe even starting ahead with dynamic programming and revising graphs.\nThere was one project which consisted 10% of the grade. I roughly spent about 13-15 hours on this. If you spend enough time on it, you should be able to ace it an get the entire 10% of the grade. We had roughly 1 homework assignment per week. They account for an insignificant portion of the grade (5%), but are strongly recommended to do as practice problems for the exams. The problems you\'ll see in the exams are very similar to HW problems. The only change I\'d like to see in the course is to have one more mid term (total 3 mid terms and one final). Due to weight-age of the exams, if one screws up a mid term, then they may be looking at a lower grade.\nFinally, a special shout out to the TA\'s for this course in Fall 2018. They were very helpful answering all the questions in Piazza and slack. Very diligent in grading the assignments and mid-terms. The course had close to 450 (prior to withdrawal date) students. The turn around time for grading the projects and the mid terms (both mid terms were prior to withdrawal date) was just one week.\nAll in all, a fantastic course, great learning, helpful students and TA\'s. I really developed a new way to approaching problems, in general. Grade doesn\'t matter, learning does! So I\'m satisfied and would absolutely recommend this course to anyone.

Here\'s how: So this spring when I took the class, I went in knowing that I needed to work on this class every day. So for the first month or so, I did at least 1 dynamic programming problem a day. And not just the ones they recommend - I did all of the ones in the DPV text, all of the ones in the Kleinberg-Tardos text. I also watched Erik Demaine\'s lectures on dynamic programming. This is all in addition to the every day requirements of this class (the homework and lectures, etc). For dynamic programming - draw the damn table on your scratch paper. Every time...draw the table! When we got around to the NP Complete problems I did the same thing - at least one problem a day. The other topics were tough as well, but these 2 topics are the most crucial to passing this course. Anything he says in the lecture is a \'key idea\' or \'key concept\' is going to show up on a test. Even if you think, how could they possibly test that? Trust me, it\'ll be on the exam.

These are the main topics you will be tested on. There are graph algorithms as well, but you will never be asked to find a shortest path or anything like that, you will need to know how the algorithm works and based on the problem presented you will need to identify whether or not the algorithm can be used to solve the problem.\nThe lectures in my opinion are only good if you read the book first, then watch them once as you take notes and then watch them again just for content. So in other words they are not as good as other OMSCS courses. If you plan on grasping the material just by looking at the lectures, you probably won\'t because the lectures go quite fast and they only explain the basics of how to do the problems.

This is a difficult class that is challenging in two ways. First, the material is difficult to learn and takes some time to fully understand. The book and lectures do a terrible job of explaining the material (the book is vague and the lectures focus primarily on mathematically proving the theorems behind the material rather than the testable material itself).\nThe second part of the challenge in this course is the way the exams and homework are graded. The rubric calls on strict adherence to very specific terminology, formatting, and nitpicks minor details. This can be frustrating because even with a mastery of the material and after solving difficult questions, you may receive a substantial markdown for trivial \"omissions\" in your solution.\nAs you go through this course, I would encourage you to stick with it even if you\'re receiving poor grades. I did very poorly on the first two exams and still managed to pull through. The very first test is the trickiest... it gets a little bit easier after that. Grades are curved pretty significantly too. Worst case, at least you\'ll get to see all of the material before taking the class a second time, so you\'ll be better prepared the next round.\nKeys to success:\n-Take this class by itself, it\'s really tough\n-Practice problems from the text book and homework on a whiteboard or on paper over and over again.\n-If you have time before the course starts, brush up on Dynamic Programming (DP)... it is the most heavily weighted topic that takes the most time to master.\n-In regards to DP: focus your efforts on variations of LIS, LCS, and Knapsack type problems... there\'s no need to get more complicated than that\n-Pay very close attention to the details of the professor\'s solutions (such as HW solutions) and make your solutions follow his particular format and verbiage\n-Don\'t blow off the project: it\'s free points... it only takes a couple days to tackle & it\'ll be in python most likely.\n-Youtube videos with graphical depictions of the algorithms in action really help\nI wish you the very best of luck!!','Very Hard','Disliked','30 hours/week'),('CS-8803-GA: Graduate Algorithms (pre-Spring 2019)','88bcac89-da06-4b05-84d9-5e1b41954072','I believe the difficulty of this class is very much related to your preparedness. I generally enjoy math and also took an algos class on Coursera a couple years ago, and I thought the course was highly enjoyable and not too difficult. If you are in a similar boat, you probably won\'t have much trouble with this course. On the other hand, if this is your first exposure to algorithms, I would highly recommend priming yourself for this course by taking a free algos class first, or you may find this course to be a lot of work.\nAnother key to this class is simply to practice a lot. A lot of the homeworks and exams come down to figuring out ways to apply the algos to a novel problem, sort of like puzzles where the algos are the tools you have to work with. Once you are in this mindset, though, it\'s pretty fun thinking of ways to solve the problems.\nOne last note about this course is that the instructional staff is excellent. Compared to other courses I\'ve taken, Dr. Vigoda is much more active on Piazza. Probably the second-most instructor participation of any course after SDP. Dr. Vigoda was very occasionally a bit snippy here and there, but I\'d rather have massive presence with occasional errors than a total lack of presence which seems to be the norm (or at least the median) for OMSCS courses.

Exams were about the same level of difficulty as the homework, so the best advice I could give is to practice doing problems a lot, especially with Dynamic Programming and NP-completeness reductions.

There is also a project for 10% of your grade, which is the only coding you will officially do in this class, though future iterations may include another project.\nThe homeworks are generally problems in the text (DPV), or very similar to them. While the previous class required a lot of proofs, this class requires informal proofs and pseudo-code. The book is definitely required, and I recommend also getting CLRS for the graphing section. The most math I encountered was during the FFT section where we had to work with complex numbers and roots of unity.\nPrepare for this class by watching the lectures, reading DPV and doing the problems.

However, it is not a simple regurgitation of the materials. It is an application of the materials and so you really have to understand and practice the use of the materials (the algorithms mostly) in solving problems because you will have to be able to apply them to other situations on the tests.\nThe grading is heavily weighted towards tests with 85% of the grade coming from tests (10% from project and 5% from homework).\nHomework, while it has little impact on the grade is a must-do. In fact, to succeed in the class I would say that you have to go out and find other homework from other courses and do those problems as well.\nThe project was a coding assignment which was interesting but not too challenging once you wrapped your head around it. They have indicated that they may add an additional coding project in a future iteration of the course, but don\'t plan on reducing the grading focus on exams.\nThis class has probably had the greatest participation in Piazza of both the instructor and the TA staff of any of the courses I have been in and that has been very helpful in understanding some of the nuances around the algorithms and their application.\nOverall a great class.','Very Hard','Loved!','30 hours/week'),('CS-8803-GA: Graduate Algorithms (pre-Spring 2019)','7b46071c-e829-46a3-aad7-d6ff9d46bf77','Excellent course, very well run especially for a new course.

There were so many times I wanted to quit because it was so difficult, but I persevered and I am pretty sure I did well enough on the final to pass. The homeworks seem almost impossible at times. However, don\'t let that dissuade you. If you can\'t do some of the problems just do the best you can (they are only worth 5% of the overall grade) and wait for the solutions to be released and then go back and learn how to do the problems. The exam questions are similar to the homeworks and actually seem a little easier than the homework problems. Professor Vigoda says he wants the HW to challenge you. So, if you can understand how to do them, you should be pretty well prepared for the exams. To prepare for this class, you can go to the course website to see the topics and watch some youtube videos on them. The MIT OCW videos were also helpful at times for a different perspective. Dr. Vigoda places a strong emphasis on Dynamic Programming. He once stated on the forums, if you don\'t know DP you won\'t pass this class. DP boggled my mind when I first encountered the topic. However, I leave the class relatively confident that I could apply it one day if necessary. The lecture videos are excellent, he repeats the information enough that it sinks in better than some courses where they just state the facts and immediately move on.

I know some students who spent 10 to 15 hours a week, but were struggling to get into the B range or were solidly in the B range.

If you fall into that category, take a discrete math course or find some way to fill in those gaps.\nMy advice: don\'t underestimate the importance of the homeworks and practice for the exams.

Much less stress that way, for me at least. It was common to see people on Slack, Sunday night before homework is due, asking questions about the first exercise. Not sure what they were thinking.\nThe exams, though, were a different animal. For those, you\'d get about twice as many exercises (usually 20-25) and could be significantly harder than the homework.

The lectures were a bit hit or miss, but the assignments were usually good about guiding you through the problems. I came into the course with some programming experience but only very little exposure to Python, and I thought it was a great introduction to Python including Pandas, NumPy and SciPy. The later assignments focused more on mathematical theory and concepts useful to data analytics such as optimization problems and algorithms, which were very math-y but also very helpful to reinforce my understanding of the workings behind these methods. It helped that there was a refresher on the linear algebra and calculus included as part of the instructional materials.\nThe fact that the assignments are autograded with unlimited submissions means you have as much time as you need to test your solutions and get as much credit as you can. The assignments are released well ahead of time so if you need to get a head start and give yourself some time off between assignments that\'s totally feasible. Some assignments were much easier than others, so I\'d say the avg workload was about 4-8 hours per week.\nThe exams worked much the same way homework did, open note/internet with no proctoring, but were much longer than the typical homework assignment and with a time limit (both midterms were 24 hrs, the final was 36 hrs). I spent about 5-8 hours with each of the three exams, but I know other students struggled with the amount of time they needed to complete the tests. The professor and TAs were responsive and made some changes to the exam format to help accommodate the students who had issues though, which I appreciated even though it didn\'t impact me much.\nOverall, highly recommended course.

However, unless you are a very experienced programmer, you can expect to spend between 12 and 15 hours of work to complete each mid term (based on the results of slack polls). Again, if you are python pro, you\'ll finish the exams in like 6 hours, but if you\'re not, plan on clearing your schedule for 24 hours because you will most likely need the time. The mid term was also like this although we were given 36 hours to complete the exam instead of 24. An improvement to be sure but still a very stressful and intense 36 hours.

I spent an average of 15 hours per week over the 15 week period on this course (including time spent on the exams, which is significant). Grading is very straightforward, with a graded homework assignment almost every week (13 in total); these count for 3-4% each, or 50% in total. The homeworks are beginner friendly, because you have an unlimited number of submissions. Midterm 1 counts 10%, Midterm 2 15%, and 25% for the Final. This term MT2 was the most challenging of all. They gave us a 24h window for MT1 and MT2, and even 36 hours for the Final; if you are a slow coder, you will use most of these time windows.

While its primary focus was more on the underlying mechanism of commonly-used packages in python, the course was nonetheless effective when getting students to think about what was required to succeed in the space.\nAs stated before, during the Spring 2018 semester there was a massive disconnect between the homework assignments and the exams. There were three exams, all of which were open-source barring collaboration with people (but open-google, short of posting your ask on stackoverflow). However, the exams consisted basically of 6 homework assignments for you to complete in as much detail as possible. Exam 1 (24 hour max) was quite reasonable as the first few homeworks were very easy and were more on the programming, but Exams 2 (24 hour max) and 3 (36 hour max) ended up being harder variants of the homework problems to be done in a shorter period of time. I still aced the class, but the exams were definitely marathons (Exam 1: 4-6 hours, Exam 2: 18 hours, Exam 3: 10 hours, but only did enough to get 80% since I\'d already guaranteed my A). Future iterations of this course will probably see updated exam logistics.\nNonetheless, nobody said it would be easy, and all things considered it was a deep enough course to justify an intro to programming for data science at the graduate level.

Surprisingly, the final only took me 6, even though we got 36 hours to complete it. The exams and homeworks were open book/note with no online proctoring. The only restriction was that we couldn\'t ask our classmates for help, so I must say that despite my complaint, I can\'t really say anything was unfair.\nI took the course together with ISYE 6501 (Introduction to analytics modeling) and it was kind of neat because we would code up a lot of the algorithms discussed in the modeling course.\nThis course is comprised of lectures and Jupyter notebooks. Lectures are well designed as well as homeworks (You get 1 per week and each one took me a few hours to complete with the tv running in the background, nothing crazy). As far as autograders go, I\'ve had much worse experiences than the one in this course. Learning to debug is extremely important, and you will certainly gain some experience in this course.\nIn terms of course content, this is what I imagine is taught at the Python 101 level, with a sprinkle of harder topics. Many of the weeks went something like: \"Here is an analytics technique/algorithm. Code it in Python. Python already has a built-in function for it, this is how that call goes...\" This is actually a pretty good way to learn, because you essentially teach yourself the way that some of Python\'s functions work by coding them manually thus giving yourself a good introduction to Python, programming in general and the analytics models.','Medium','Liked','7 hours/week'),('CSE-6040: Computing for Data Analytics','hDHe4nrsEjMcx7OmMn6t3pBHT3H2','Overall this was a decent course.

It felt like the homework didn\'t prepare you at all for the exam so there was a lot of trying to research and learn stuff during the exam which adds to the amount of time needed to complete it.

That said, if you do well on the labs, you can still get an A even with middling performance on the exams.\nI took this course to fulfill a foundational requirement, to challenge myself, and to get exposure to HPC. I came into the class with some light experience in C. I had to spend a lot of time on the labs wrestling with C issues that a more experienced C programmer wouldn\'t have.

I previously took IOS/AOS so I thought that would give me a leg up for projects but I still found myself scrambling to complete projects. I ended up getting full credit for all projects but it cost me - I spent ALL my free time writing code and reimplementing methods to try to get better scores. ** MY MAJOR COMPLAINT - Though I scored full marks, other people got crazy performance gains as compared to my implementations. While the lectures and papers leading up to projects give hints as to methods to use, there aren\'t any official recaps to let you know what you should have done.\nExams are very difficult. I am not entirely sure the motivating philosophy behind them, but I suspect the goal is to \"elevate\" your understanding of course material.

Their goals are really exciting (parallel list ranking, the N-Body problem, distributed communication collectives, TeraSort, and funnel-sort), but I thought the instructions were a bit lacking.

Do not wait till the weekend they\'re due. -The Udacity \"autograder\" can be a complete pain in the behind. At times the output isn\'t very helpful on why it failed. On top of that, the TAs generally don\'t expound upon what the grader is actually testing. Depending on the project, you can spend a significant amount of time just passing the autograder. -The projects have roughly a two week cadence.

The course focuses more on algorithms and divided into 3 parts:\nShared memory parallelism (OpenMP)\nDistributed memory parallelism (MPI)\nCache based optimizations\nLectures: The course content is very good, but may require multiple readings/viewings before it can be assimilated. This was my 5th course, and my toughest so far. The instructor is hilarious. His jokes are very creative and funny and perhaps compensate for the heavy lecture material.\nAssignments: There are a total of 5 assignments. Of these 3 are reasonable. 2 are very tough (There are students who spent more than 40-50 hrs on an assignment and still couldn\'t complete it). If you get an assignment to work you get about 80-90% credit. The remaining 10-20% goes for performance improvements. The problem is that if you don\'t get the assignment to work, you lose big time. And that can be harsh, because many students spend most of their time just getting it to work. Do not underestimate the assignments and start early. Also, you need to be comfortable with C, C++ (especially pointer handling). Without this you will struggle in implementing some assignments.\nMidterms/Final exam: These can be quite tough. The midterm had a class average of around 19/50. The final exam had a class average of about 29/50. You have to be really well versed in the course content to do well in the exams.\nGrading: I do not know the exact grade distribution but based on the numbers shown on this website, the percentage of A\'s seem to be the lowest among current courses while the number of C\'s seemed to be the highest compared to current courses. Not the course to take if you want to get away with an easy grade.\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you are interested in knowing more about HPC algorithms and are willing to work hard.','Very Hard','','20 hours/week'),('CSE-6220: Intro to High-Performance Computing','dda7acf2-e878-43aa-9975-3cbe35aa42e8','Intro to HPC has been the best class I\'ve taken in the OMSCS.

The fact of the matter though is that I respectfully disagree with the 12 hours/week of effort average number. I just exchanged some notes with another student (an awesome one none less), and his opinion about the course is very much aligned with mine.\nFirst half is dedicated to learning the basics of R, which made the workload per week reasonably in line with the 12 hours reported to date (assuming you never saw R in your life, like I hadn\'t at the time). However, the second half seemed to be a race to the finish line with a lot packed in juts a few weeks (at least for me). The actual specific subject of the class is all presented on the second half, and the fact I took the class on the Summer semester certainly didn\'t help the cause. I felt I have put in 30+ hours (especially on the projects) per week on the second half of the course and still felt I could have delivered a better work product at the end.\nI suppose that, since this is a Master\'s degree course, one gets what one puts into any class and I can attest I learned a ton. And I think I also suppose that, if the objective is to just get a grade at the end that is B or better, one can probably put in little effort on it (probably even less than the reported 12 hours), and still get away with a good grade. However, if you are an avid learner who will try to acquire and absorb everything till the last ounce of knowledge offered, be prepared to put in some serious work, especially on the second half of the course. However, all in all, I would take it again for sure. I learned quite a bit about regression (logistic and linear), stochastic gradient descent. I have one criticism, which is the fact that very little attention is paid to regularization as it was very rushed through at the end of the semester and no practical activity really demanded it to be implemented (though the final exam has about 50% of all questions on it). These subjects can be seen as an intro to Machine Learning, and I believe it will help me quite a bit when I finally face Dart Vader (CS-7641 - Machine Learning).

Though I expected the work to be difficult (my courses last semester in the OMSA program certainly were), it has bordered on impossible at several points given the unreasonably complicated nature of the work we are assigned. I spent more time decoding confusing instructions and being my own IT support this semester than I did working on any visualization projects or concepts. I was very close to withdrawing from the class and if it weren’t for the group project and the fear of letting my teammates down, I probably would have dropped it.\nFor each homework set I spent at least the first week (40+ hours) just trying to get my computer set-up with the software/environments necessary to even start programming. In several instances this has required making changes to the firmware, multiple uninstalls and re-installs all of which are incredibly time-consuming and I think not the point of this course. My only computer is my work computer and I have felt quite nervous about how these changes I have made might impact my machine and my ability to do my job if it were to crash.\nTo complete a homework assignment students were required to join Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, both of which required entering personal credit card information. For each of these services there was the potential of running up thousands of dollars in charges if a mistake was made. This is an entirely unacceptable risk to ask students to take. Often learning takes place when mistakes are made and to put a financial burden on students who are already paying to learn is wrong.\nAt several points throughout the semester direct messages to the instructors went unanswered for days. At one point a very urgent message (labeled as such in the subject line) was ignored for 84 hours. At the point it was answered it was too late.\nThe difficulty I have had this semester has caused me to question my future in this program. If the 40+ hours per week of work needed for this course is indicative of any future courses, continuing to pursue this degree will be incompatible with maintaining my full-time job and family responsibilities.

Dr. Joyner and the TAs did a nice job keeping us up-to-date and on-track, though it\'s a continued pet peeve of mine when an instructor literally ignores their students for the entire semester.\nContent-wise, the first half of the course\'s lectures were pretty good. Dr Lebanon\'s explanations and manner-of-speaking tend to make things needlessly complicated, especially when getting into the more math-heavy topics, but nothing was too overwhelming. The second half of the course was a lot harder to follow, again mainly due to the way the content was presented. Several students posted alternate sources of information on Piazza that made the concepts much easier to understand. It\'s like too much focus was placed on the theory and exact formulas rather than what it actually means in practice.\nThe projects and homeworks were all pretty fair, in my opinion, even though I came in with no R experience whatsoever. Some assignments were intimidating to start, but became more manageable after spending some time playing with them. The TAs also posted helpful hints for some assignments. The exams were both a bit crude, handled via ProctorTrack. The midterm had a lot of disagreement with wording and ambiguity. The instructor team did eventually address a few of the questions about a month later and gave some points back, but other questions were never clarified.\nGrade-wise, it still seems fairly easy to get an A as long as you\'re not waiting until the last minute to do an assignment (and almost everything is available from the first week of class, so there\'s no need to wait). Four homeworks worth 10% each, two projects worth 20% each, two exams worth 10% each, and 5 activities worth 1% each. Since that\'s 105%, you\'ve got 15% of leeway to stay in \"A\" range.

I think that the first half of the course is generally useful and not overly challenging. They do provide pointers to an entire book on visualization using the ggplot2 package, which if you read from cover to cover and play around with it could satisfy those who already have exposure to R and ggplot2. The second half of the course will probably be challenging if it is your first exposure to linear and logistic regression, and it will probably not be overly difficult if you have studied those topics before. I did not have that exposure before this class, and the rest of my review assumes that.\nAs for pacing, the class is relatively slow in the beginning. You are probably looking at more like 6-8 hours per week on average of required work. If you dive into additional references and optional assignments, you can spend more (and get a deeper understanding). The pace really picks up from the first project onward. As students in past semesters have noted, the projects will take up as much time as you have, and you will always feel like you could have done more. On average, you are probably looking at more like 12-15 hours per week at that point, and it may be bursty.\nNow, as for the class logistics... I think most of the reviews for the semester have been at an overly negative extreme, and the one just below seems a bit too positive (hello fellow undergrad alum!). There were problems.

Another challenge was the difficulty in making group decisions when a group leader wasn\'t established and the whole team couldn\'t find time to meet virtually.\nI will address the concern about using Azure and AWS with a personal credit card as stated in another review. While, yes, it was annoying and uncomfortable to provide that information, for both services we got much, much more free credit than was needed to complete the assignment, and students who did go over the free limit were able to get the charges waived by calling customer support and explaining the situation. The Azure part of the assignment could be completed on a personal computer and then uploaded to the server, eliminating any chance of error/using up the credit.\nI learned so much in this class and was exposed to a large number of data technologies. I know there are some people who struggled greatly with this class, but I found it comparable to (if not easier than) my undergrad engineering courses at a top-ranked engineering school, so the quality was what I expected. I think the class does have room for improvement, and could use more TA support to improve communication and responses to Piazza.

It was a useful course to me because I got to learn big data technologies like spark, hadoop, scala etc., - but you could have learned more if you just read a book on each of those subjects as this course does not go deep into each technology.\nThere were a lot of difficulties setting up env in the beginning. TAs were kinda responsive, but not very helpful. The homeworks were not structured well at all! I did have plenty of time to complete each homework, but I had no idea whether my code was right or wrong! There was no feedback or guidance on this part. So, for many assignments - students who check their code on few test cases after submission learned that they had missed a minor edge case which was only in the TA\'s test set and lost marks due to that. IMHO, if you actually want to learn big data technologies, grab a few books with big data tech. names on them and just do the programs in the book. You\'ll learn a lot more that way.\nThe only interesting part of the course was the project (which fortunately was a huge chunk of your final grade). You are allowed to choose from a wide range of pre-selected topics. The project can be done in a group of 3 or solo. You can also get access to datasets which are normally not available for free access online. I would say this was the only useful thing I got out of this course.\nI would assume this course is going to be restructured or rebuilt soon because of the complaints that were made during my semester. Overall, if you are not comfortable learning and implementing with 3-4 technologies in a short period of time, you are going to have a hard time.

The professor of record has no interaction with the class whatsoever -- not even a single piazza post -- except each group for the group projects were allowed to meet with him for 10 minutes over 3 days of his choosing. Then after we all cleared out our schedule for the great honor, at the last minute, he cancelled and told everybody on that day they needed to move to day x.

I don\'t think that\'s exactly the case. I found myself googling things like \"how to left join pig\" and adapting some snippet from S. O.

Every two weeks, there were students withdrawing from this class, and only 30+ survived till the end of this semester.\nFirst half of the class is about 4 homeworks. Within two weeks, you need to learn new tools, watch tutorials online (in addition to lectures and labs) and finish the coding assignment for each homework.

There is a pool of topics for you to select, and you are also free to come up with your own topic. Your task is to use the big data tools you\'ve learned to \"reproduce and improve\" a recently published journal paper in the field of Big Data for Healthcare. Given the complexity and shear size of the data, even partially \"reproducing\" other\'s work is not as easy as it sounds. You can secure a good grade by simply reproducing the result itself.

Personally, I agree that this is the best way to learn (by trying to tackle something I am not quite sure how to do yet), but I can understand some students preferring a more structured approach, where they are told more explicitly how to do what they need to do.

More frustrating was answers provided by one of TA used to be incorrect.

To succeed in this course you need to spend upto 5 extra hrs on your research and study beyond the material provided.\nCase studies and programs were provided in the course material which helped a lot for homeworks but again due to material quality and incorrectness, you need to make sure interpretations for those are valid.

The assignments were released early enough that we generally had 2-3 weeks to work on them. Lectures were longer than other OMSA classes, but the assignments weren\'t extremely time intensive if you paid attention to the data examples in the lectures.\nBy far the biggest challenge in this course was miscommunication and a lack of clarity around terms. The course videos frequently had mistakes, and the course staff did a bad job of communicating (both notifying about and correcting the errors and also about other course logistics). The true/false questions on the assignments and midterms were extremely frustrating because the language often was not clear.\nAll that said, I really enjoyed the course material and felt the class was a very reasonable workload.

After taking this class, the takeaways should be the model code and the interpretation of the models both in a statistical way and in layman\'s terms. The course material itself is quite straightforward, plug-and-play in just about every way and requires more regurgitation skill rather than critical thinking (making the exam open book made the course disgustingly easy).\nThere are no surprises in this class - everything on the exam will have been discussed in enough detail in either the lecture videos or homework. If the question was ambiguous or flat-out wrong, the professor would personally review and clarify, even refunding lost points.\n5 homework assignments, each having a multiple choice section for a small portion of the grade and then a couple of self/peer reviewed sections having to do with the data analysis. Each one had a few weeks\' worth of time to complete, so the timing was quite reasonable unless you procrastinated. 3 exams with the same format as the homework, just spanning additional subjects and 2.5 hours to complete. All reasonable, unless you had a bug in your code.\nOnly two drawbacks in this class - the material is incredibly dry and repetitive. There are 15 minute lectures for what could be explained at a high level in 3, but get drawn out and watched regardless (easily half of the week\'s workload would be taking notes). The key takeaways will be identified in the lecture through boxes (hard copies of the powerpoints screw with physical note-takers like myself, though).\nThe second drawback is the lack of statistical discipline by the professor at times. There has been some confusion when the professor uses terms that are not correct in a statistical sense (goodness-of-fit vs. predicting power) early in the course that screwed with lectures later in the course. During this semester, a couple of the videos could have been re-recorded due to some mistakes (I expect this to improve over the course of multiple iterations).\nAgain, overall a good course to learn a few powerful, easy-to-understand models and a fairly reasonable class in terms of workload to pair with a perhaps more workload intensive class.','Easy','Liked','7 hours/week'),('ISYE-6414: Regression Analysis','b8DPytU1tegtPujUCz6I9iphGtX2','As others have mentioned, the videos and assignments need some editing.

Many of the multiple choice & T/F questions were also very focused on technical theory (i.e \"what is the sampling distribution of the prediction of future responses under the Poisson regression model\") , which is fine for Stats majors, but for OMSA, I will not be retaining this level of detail.

Dr. Sokol\'s lectures were engaging, informative, and clearly understandable. I don\'t know if there\'s much he could have done better with the lectures, they were that good. Even when he was working through formulae and variables, I was still able to follow along most of the time, and if I wasn\'t, just a couple repeat viewings and I was on the same page. The course surveys countless topics at a rapid speed, but I never felt like it was moving too fast. I\'m amazed at how much I know now compared to the start of the semester.\nHomeworks mostly use R for building and evaluating models. I\'d had no experience with R before starting the course, so the early going was a bit rough, but once I got up to speed I was much more comfortable. The assignments are designed to set you on your own path of discovery and learning, and I found that I benefited the most from them when I approached them that way. On the weeks where I was more time-constrained or felt a bit lost in R, I found the TA office hours sessions to be very helpful. I never attended one live, I only ever watched video recordings. I did my best not to carbon copy everything the TAs had done, because they basically provided you with the answers most of the time - even something as simple as changing the names of variables helped me internalize the solution better than copying everything to the letter.\nPeer reviewing has pros and cons, the biggest pro is that I saw a few really impressive submissions that actually taught me a thing or two (especially when people took the time to create Jupyter notebooks out of their submissions) but the worst con was reviewing some of the poorer submissions or the ones that just lifted the answers from the TA office hours with no elaboration. So depending on the luck of the draw you could find the peer review process to be educational or not. Also, feedback from other students was very inconsistent, sometimes you\'d get great suggestions about how you could have done things differently, but most of the time it seems I got no feedback at all or something brief like \"good job\" with no detail.\nExams were very fair, and I didn\'t mind the proctoring as much as I thought I would (but I\'m also not a parent so a quiet, private session was easy for me to manage). Exam questions usually required you to think through every answer and choose carefully, and I thought they did a good job testing my understanding of the material.\nOverall I cannot recommend this course highly enough, and I strongly suggest taking it in your first semester as an OMSA student if you can.','Medium','Loved!','7 hours/week'),('ISYE-6501: Introduction to Analytics Modeling','mSH1AkYgykTWViQRuVE3NcwiJU63','My background: Mechanical engineer with minimal programming experience.

When studying for the final, I was able to review and watch all lectures within a few hours (2x speed).\nHomework: Like many reviews, I will agree that the homework assignments can be disproportionate in terms of overall grade weight and time input, especially if you\'re like me with very little R programming experience coming into the class. Still, good practice utilizing the concepts learned in lectures. Peer grading can be very inconsistent, but generally forgiving overall.\nProject: No coding, open ended. The opposite of HW. Equal to over half of HW grade weight but equal to the amount of work for a single HW. Some adjustments could be made between the two.\nQuizzes (midterms): These can be pretty tricky so you really have to have a solid understanding of the material. An item that was only mentioned for a few seconds on a single slide could be a question on any quiz. A \"cheat sheet\" is allowed for all quizzes but I rarely used them. I believe they were a teaching mechanism to re-enforce learning more than they were as a reference on a quiz.\nProfessor/TAs: Solid. Dr. Sokol\'s personality really shows in the lectures and he clearly enjoys the material which also gets the student naturally engaged in learning.

TA\'s weekly office hour was very very helpful to clarify confusions in a homework. Few troll in peers can give you a low grade without any comment, which is frustrating.

First, the homework and course project are low weight compared to the amount of work required and understanding gained (16% hw, 9% project). In addition, one feels a bit cheated when the course project is merely peer-graded and your peers don\'t provide much feedback. The peer grading in general was not very helpful as I rarely got any comments, just a numeric score -- I would learn more with tougher HW feedback from an instructor. The exams felt unnecessarily high-pressure and high-stakes, because they were (75% of grade for 3 exams). While about 80% of the exam questions were pretty easy, 5-10% were subtle/difficult, and about 10-15% were just badly constructed -- either expecting us to \"think on our feet\" about applying/combining concepts that only got minimal lecture time, or having ambiguous wording/intent, or relying on a very artificial set-up, or making too many assumptions and providing too little context. Some were major traps for people prone to overthinking. In addition, the exams leaned toward fewer questions with higher point values each, which can really bite you. Fortunately there\'s a fairly generous curve that will add 5-6 % points. In general, if you want a solid pre-curve A, you should do extra reading on each modeling technique covered and your studying should focus more on big-picture, situational application and pros/cons of different techniques.\nAll in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and learned a ton.

To do so, I have relied on various books, sites and blogs, but also used the discussion forums which are definitely a key to success for this course. This course is greatly designed and the knowledge acquired after finishing this course is definitely its strength.\nLogistics-wise, on average one homework per week is to be submitted, the difficulty varies based on the content of the course, I have spend 8 to 10 hours a week between the course and the homework. The peer-grading can be frustrating at times, but equally rewarding when receiving a feedback on the submitted homework, which is not necessary the case. The weight of the homework in the overall grade is quite low compared to the level of effort. However, the time spent on the homeworks is useful to prepare for the midterms and the exams, which are more concept-based and of average difficulty.\nPrerequisites-wise, elementary knowledge of R is definitely helpful to focus on the concepts rather than wasting time learning the language in parallel. Dedicated office hours will also help with R if required. Basic knowledge of math is required but the course is not deep diving into complex math formulas and theorems, which made it easy from that perspective.\nCourse team-wise, the course is provided in the perfect format, appropriate for online learning but still ensuring the quality of traditional academics.

My only complaint (and this is similar to optimization, from what I hear) is that the material is very theoretical, rigorous and mathy while providing few if any opportunities for actually building a simulation. Perhaps that is another course, I don\'t know. One thing is for sure, though, you will come out of this class with a solid understanding of the considerations involved in conducting a simulation study. The experience in actually building one, however, will come with practice later.','Medium','Liked','10 hours/week'),('ISYE-6644: Simulation','bEy99O4fUIWkIHywmbtqHlWbr1m2','Course materials are top notch, I enjoyed so much watching lectures and trying out Arena software to model simulation like call center etc. Homework are well thought to prepare students for tests.

Overall, maybe 80% has to do with the math and about 20% is actually using simulation and the simulation language. There will be demonstrations and case studies, but those will be more for self-enrichment as the exams cover the math and simulation concepts.\nGrade breakdown came to 3 exams (30% each), one cheat sheet for exam 1, two cheat sheets for exam 2, and three cheat sheets for exam 3.

Last 10% is homework.\nProfessor is an interesting and animated guy who keeps his long lectures interesting (compared to management who keeps their long lectures boring). Lecture material goes into a lot more proofs than most people would be comfortable with, and whether it contributes to learning...your mileage may vary. Second pass at development could probably benefit from cutting down on proofs and shifting the bandwidth towards a solo or group project to simulate some real-world process.

The material is often highly abstract, and the future rewards seem uncertain, as if the class was an experiment in reinforcement learning. Entering the class with a strong interest was helpful to push through the early math portion, stick with it. The course begins by focusing on core mathematical building blocks like linear algebra, set theory, and convexity. A good understanding of this material pays dividends when the class begins to introduce concepts like search spaces, second order cone programming, and simplex.\nThis class focuses on the math and reasoning behind basic optimization techniques. In my opinion, this is the most important thing to understand about optimization before moving on to other optimization topics. Some students in the class had hoped for more applications of optimization techniques to real-world problems. While there are numerous real-world examples explained in the videos, the time spent actually applying optimization to real-world problems in the homeworks and tests is minimal. The class also doesn\'t really delve into the computational side of optimization. To be fair, that would probably make a good follow up class. Simple fixes like providing vectorized homework solutions could help improve the class in this regard.\nOverall I enjoyed this class because I enjoyed the material.

The homework is so simplistic it\'s almost pointless. To bring this class up to a similar content level of other OMSA courses you\'d basically need to double the amount of content. For example we spent four weeks of a ten week term covering linear regression and it could have easily been managed in two weeks. This is a topic that has been covered in some form or fashion in three of the four other classes I have taken. No one in this class should need this slow an introduction to this topic (this is an advanced core class after all). The topics later in the semester, network analysis, text analytics and association mining were better but they were covered at a pretty superficial level to me. This class would have been better if we dove into the details on these topics rather than spend so much time on a topic that everyone in this class should be fairly familiar with at this point (linear regression)\nThe homework assignments are not hard, but they do nothing to enhance your understanding of the content or prepare you for what is expected on the exam. Most of the homeworks are basically a reperformance of the sample code provided in lecture. Almost zero thought or analysis is required.\nI would have rated the difficulty as very easy if it hadn\'t been for the final exam. The homework and sample exam questions did not prepare me for the level of detail demanded on the first part of the exam (50 multiple choice questions). Given my performance on part 1 I made a better effort to prepare for part two of the exam. I felt prepared for part two content wise but not prepared for the awful format. Exam questions in a pdf, answers placed in a word document and 30 questions almost all of them requiring coding resulted in a three hour frenzy of coding, alt-tabbing and copy and pasting.\nThis was another disappointing class from the business school.

Getting into the course, I had lofty expecations. However the reality was very depressing. It seems the person who put together the syllabus decided that stitching together hundreds of 20 minutes rambling by a mix of uninterested professors from Accounting, Marketing, Finance and Strategy is enough to make OMSA students fork out a thousand dollars for this course. On top of that, they will make you buy study packs to line the pockets of the professors (do not buy them, you will not miss anything). There is no rhyme or reason on why certain topics were included or emphasized (quick example: Venture Capital investments, dilutions etc.). I pity the on-campus MBA students who have to endure such torture after paying 50 grands per year.\nThe grading system is designed to penalize the students. All the emphasis is on 2 big ones: mid-term and end-term. If you mess up any one, you are toast. There is no project, no case study to work on and no analytic assignment. At least they should try to be honorable and stop the blatant cheating: Pls. remove the term \"for Analytics\" from \"Business Fundamentals for Analytics\".\nIn short, try not to take this course and apply for waiver. If you cannot, avoid taking this at the start of your association with Gatech. Else you will lose respect for US education.

I did an economics minor during my undergrad, took a few other business courses, and work for an insurance company so perhaps that made the material seem a little more interesting and applicable to me. A lot of the information about marketing and strategy is very helpful for understanding why the company I work for makes certain decisions.\nThe homework assignments seemed fairly easy and the most difficult exam questions would be very similar. Some of the exam questions would be asked about small unimportant details, which was annoying, but each exam had an opportunity for extra credit so it seemed somewhat fair.','Easy','Liked','6 hours/week'),('MGT-6754: Business Fundamentals for Analytics','liv1PfFVu4dY8W3FfbPKL94tYrV2','If you have some background in business, I would definitely recommend you ask to substitute. The material is very crammed, and since there are only 4 HWs which make up a chunk of your grade, there is very little opportunity to go wrong. There is a lot of memorization for the final and if you are not good at that, then this course may not be for you.','Hard','Disliked','7 hours/week'),('MGT-6754: Business Fundamentals for Analytics','T8q2Q3C30Bg0jREHmfJPrD89YYA2','This class is in need of a top-to-bottom overhaul. Let\'s start from the top: a class called \"Business Fundamentals for Analytics\" should, at some point, mention \"Analytics\" somewhere. They didn\'t even try to connect it with the subject that 100% of its students came to study.\nInstead, this is a hodge-podge of (way, way too many) business concepts crammed together, taught with no connection to one another in four batches by four professors. The first lecturer, teaching business accounting, was absolutely atrocious. He clearly was just winging his way through his lectures, rambling with maybe a loose outline in front of him. Editing the transcripts into some semblance of a coherent study tool, it was possible to edit out 40-70% of the text without any loss of information, so redundant and bloated was the text. The second lecturer was marginally better, but his handwriting in the few problems we were given as examples was atrocious, and he would throw out acronyms without explanation.\nThere were far too few checks for understanding and practice problems, and then the homework and exams were brutally unforgiving. Accounting problems that would take 10-20 minutes to complete would have single, graded all-or-nothing multiple-choice submissions (and sometimes, fill-in-the-blank, better-get-it-exactly-right-the-first-time fields). All of the other choices were gotchas based on common errors you may have made because the inadequate teaching you received hadn\'t prepared you to do it exactly right.\nAnd then abruptly midway through the course, the graded homework stopped, replaced by a torrent of lectures -- nearly 100 more videos crammed full of micro-topics with no indication as to what was important, what would be tested on, what was intended to ground larger important concepts. The practice problems were absolutely all over the place, making it totally unclear as to what we could expect on the final.\nStaff didn\'t seem to care about student\'s concerns when these were voiced. Flury\'s most common response to students worried about their grade was that the grades overall were adequate. When students said concepts weren\'t clear, the typical response was essentially that, yes, they were. Oh, sorry, our bad, I guess.\nThis was my fourth online class through Georgia Tech and by far the worst. I thoroughly enjoyed the other three, and look forward to the rest of the program. Had MGT 6754 been the first I took, I would not have returned. The contrast is about what I would expect from a school with a top-ten-rated analytics program and a business school described by the Financial Times as \"third-tier.\"','Hard','Strongly Disliked','10 hours/week'),('MGT-6754: Business Fundamentals for Analytics','rLVAClqdmTbnqkc0yZ2OBUitLZu2','This class is terrible. I hated it and every week regretted trying not to get a course waiver for it. I have my undergrad in business, but I am always hesitant to skip courses as I feel that you can always learn something. In the end, I learned very little in this class. There are two major issues with this class, one the professors have no clue how to teach an online course in this format and two, the content of the class is too generic. The clearest example of that is their videos. The videos are basically just one hour lectures broken up into smaller segments. The videos are too long and inefficient and some of them (strategy and marketing) end up sounding as if the professor is just reading out of a text book. The videos are generally long and rambling. It makes them hard to rewatch if you need to brush up on concepts. There is very little in the way of graded assignments and no homework assignments that cover marketing or strategy. When I finished the second finance homework (the last homework of the semester) is was Halloween and I didn\'t touch this class again for almost a month. The exams are fine. The no partial credit thing is brutal on the exams. So many of the questions are of the \"Pick all that apply\" type and to miss one and get zero credit is dumb. There are high point value finance questions that are quite involved where one small error could torpedo your answer and materially impact your grade. On the final 28 of the last 108 points of the exam were tied up in four fairly involved financial calculations that you are doing with an on screen calculator (set aside the fact that only an idiot would not do this in excel or without a financial calculator).\nThe content of this class also needs a rework. This class is so generic that you could require it in ANY non business graduate program and the class would not need to be changed in any way. Analytics is NEVER mentioned. Even when you\'re in the marketing module where it is obvious that a detailed discussion of analytics could add value, it doesn\'t happen. The content goes way too far into the weeds. I am studying to be an analytics professional not get an MBA. Far too much time in finance and accounting was spent on how to low level detail calculations for things like NPV, weighted average cost of capital and activity based costing . I can see needing to know what these are and how they are used, but I will never be asked to take this down to this level.\nThe content of the course just reeks of laziness honestly. Either the business school doesn\'t understand how to do online education or they don\'t care.','Medium','Strongly Disliked','3 hours/week'),('MGT-6754: Business Fundamentals for Analytics','m7cEiZuRuiZOk4e12kUzmrxp15H2','As someone with zero business background from undergrad, I did feel like 6754 crammed in a wide-ranging survey of business topics that gave me a good feel for the terrain. The content was quite enlightening for me in that sense. Do I now know what\'s in a corporation\'s financial statement and what the parts of a balance sheet mean? Yes. How to carefully break down product costs? Yep. How VCs generally work and how they\'d value a startup? Check. How marketers focus on segmentation, targeting, positioning, and those famous 4 P\'s? Right. What the heck business strategy consultants think about? Roger. None of which I knew before. For that I\'m grateful.\nHowever, the presentation was extremely dry (like a video textbook, as another reviewer put it) and spent far too much time on minutiae instead of exploring big concepts, applying them on our own (which is how I really learn), or connecting them to analytics. I was expecting at least to do one project-type assignment, such as creating a mock business strategy or marketing plan, but no, that kind of deeper/applied thinking counted squat toward your grade. Instead, to satisfy the gradebook, you had to subject yourself to a merciless grind that I can only describe as memorizing shuffled decks of cards and hand-calculating answers to story problems that combine 7th grade math with financial jargon.','Medium','Disliked','6 hours/week'),('MGT-6754: Business Fundamentals for Analytics','7Ku2ttJxLWSHPXmEIXJkMl68jcd2','As a graduate of OMSCS and someone who is a good ways through the new OMSA program, I can say this is, by a wide margin, the worst course I have taken as a graduate student on all metrics. The lectures are twenty minute sleeping pills where a menagerie of different professors read slides verbatim and provide long, rambling, and excessive examples to the point of further confusion. The course content is all over the place and seems hastily assembled, as if someone just concatenated four standard-length courses into a Frankenstein\'s monster of business school intro courses. Grades are few and far between (the two exams count for 70% of the grade), and the professor (the one of four presumably in charge) seems to have little if any grasp on online quiz structure, having involved, high point value multi-step questions for which there is no partial credit (e.g. \"Select the correct eight of these fifteen possible answers\"), and incorrect responses that seem to want to actively trick students into wrong answers instead of guiding the learning process. On Piazza, when the professor chooses to make an appearance, he is usually combative and seems to often resent the sheer audacity of those who may want to actually learn this material. The course would be a poor refresher for those pursuing an MBA, and seems especially inappropriate for those pursuing a degree in computational analytics. Towards the end it became clear that at no point would any of the material actually tie into analytics, making it even further baffling that this course is foundational for the analytics program at Georgia Tech.\nFor those considering taking this course, I can simply suggest you put it off as long as possible, in hopes the course will be reworked or removed altogether.\nFor those responsible for building and administering OMS programs, I can only say this course is an embarrassment and actively damages the reputation of the OMS community.','Hard','Disliked','10 hours/week'),('MGT-6754: Business Fundamentals for Analytics','kR1yk3zbzySjxClUZbtxUtPeaSP2','This course is an amalgamation of 5/6 semesters of undergrad business administration courses -- Financial Accounting, Managerial Accounting, Corporate Finance, Marketing, and Strategy.

It is a disgrace to student taking time away from busy life and want to learn something useful.\nI hated this class with a passion. I got an A out of this class so this is nothing personal. But boy was I disappointed.\nThis is going to be long. Here’s the tl;dl: If you hold a business degree in either undergrad or MBA, definitely absolutely opt-out of it. You won’t learn anything new. If you can’t opt-out, perhaps wait until they rework this class. With the numerous negative reviews I think/hope they will have to do something about it.\nHere we go…\nFirst I should say I don\'t have a problem with learning accounting, costing, finance, marketing, strategy. In fact I still consider the very existence of business classes in the curriculum to be one of the highlights of Georgia Tech’s analytics degree program. But this class is just horrible. It has “Analytics” in the name, is one of the few (3?) classes created specifically for the analytics program (all others are existing classes from other majors). But throughout the class the professors hadn’t mentioned it even once, except perhaps the couple of times when they referred to us. They did not even attempt to relate the material to analytics at all. And it shouldn’t be difficult. I don’t expect them going into much detail on the “how” – that’s for the next class, but it should be very easy to at least mention areas of application. For example, in valuation there was this comparable method, in marketing there was market segmentation and evaluation of advertising. All have obvious links to analytics. They could have just spent a minute linking them to analytics concepts like clustering, design of experiment, etc. But nope there was none of that.\nAnd then there was the teaching itself, which was a complete opposite of the awesome ISYE6501 where the videos were concise, to the point and easy to follow. This class had long (10-15 mins) videos where the professors were just reading from the scripts. A couple professors at least make some better PowerPoints slides, but the last professor would put a whole paragraph of text on the slide while he talk on and on. On the forum the professors (mostly just the main one since he was the one who interacted with us) were not exactly helpful. They could get impatient and defensive really fast. They probably thought we were either asking stupid question or trying to be smartasses. Their attitude really discourage learning. They could even get borderline rude. There was this one time when a student asked for clarification on one of the frameworks, and he would say, and I quote: \"Why don’t you google John Kotter read more about his approach\". Go figure.\nEven worse was the homework and exams. For machine grading purposes, just about everything was multiple choice, with no chance of partial credits. You would be asked to do multi-step problems that involved creating a balance sheet or multi-year NPV calculation (by hand In exams!). If you made one single mistake you would lose all points – it could amount to a whole point (homework) or even 3 points (exam) on your course grade. Other non-math problem tended to ask about the tiniest detail of the material. There were also select-all-true (and sometime all-false! Better be careful!) from 5-10 boxes and again they were all-or-nothing. All of these made the homework and exams very stressful.\nAgain, my grade turned out ok. But I just hated wasting 3 credit hours on this class when there are so many interesting electives out there. Avoid it at all costs unless/until you hear better reviews in the future.','Medium','Strongly Disliked','4 hours/week'),('MGT-6754: Business Fundamentals for Analytics','TiVdWPQQNVYMuNvpXOpbeunfraB3','Alot of people seem to be discussing the class, but that is only half of what is completely wrong with this course. The other half is the head instructor. Dr. Alan Flury is most likely the biggest jack-ass you will ever meet. He is unable to admit fault with himself, even when he is clearly wrong. He is basically what would happen if you had Donald Trump run a business class. The OMSA program and Georgia Tech should all do themselves a favor and just fire this man. He is toxic. He is disgustingly rude. He is about as personable as the Ebola Virus. If you misunderstand any concept that is ambiguous in the class, it cannot possibly be his problem, it must be that the students are morons. Or the students just are not getting it. But it is never his issue, it is always ours. If we do have the audacity to say he has done something wrong, instead of admitting his error, he will double down on his wrongness. He gets unnecessarily defensive. I am in complete awe of how a man with such a disgusting behavior is any where close to an academic institution. This man is a disgrace and an embarrassment to Georgia Tech. He runs the class like a prison. He thinks it is better for the homeworks to be these all-or-nothing multiple choice questions that do not help with learning, but test what you have learned through the videos. I feel like he made this class unnecessarily difficult, purposefully. I think he has some deep-rooted Napoleonic Complex that he needs to get checked out by a psychologist.

For one, the material is way too dense, and the professors (there are multiple professors) think shoving in a lot of videos every week will suffice. Also, there\'s a textbook and these Harvard course packs listed on the syllabus which come out to $150. We were told later that they weren\'t needed. But since this is a business course, the professors of course would love to line up their pockets for material that they sell (Prof. Flury is the author of the textbook).\nMoving on to TAs. They were terrible. They never answered the questions at hand. It\'s as if they simply sought to get credit for answering questions in a perfunctory fashion, not elaborating on the answers beyond what was mentioned in class.\nExams were tough in the sense that they required VERY specific memorization. You couldn\'t miss an iota of information to get a decent score. And the exams did NOT allow for partial credit, despite questions in the form of \"select the options below that...\" So, if you don\'t know the 4 correct ambiguous answer choices, you don\'t get any credit.\nThis course embodies not practicing what they preach: A chunk of the course focuses on \"Strategy & Innovation\" and they preach about companies who couldn\'t adapt. Well, this course simply tries to shoehorn conventional in person education into an online format. It just doesn\'t work.\nFor full disclosure, I received a B (86%). I\'m not really bitter about my grade. Sure, an A would\'ve been nice. But I simply stopped caring towards the end. I was just eager to finish the course.\nThis course left a bad taste in my mouth for GATech\'s program overall.','Hard','Strongly Disliked','10 hours/week'),('MGT-6754: Business Fundamentals for Analytics','MeImDRacyya4b7HRkhvlEZxvulw2','The overall presentation of this course left much to be desired. The professors could have been replaced with books and supplementary powerpoints and the course would have been more effective. Instead, we have topics consisting of a string of 20-minute videos of powerpoint readers that, on average, contained the efficacy of prescription-strength Ambien on a warm summer day. Few, if any, of the topics had anything really to do with Analytics as we can expect to use it in real life, and caused students to wonder who was paid off to make the class required. Towards the end of the class I found myself both 1) not learning anything and 2) just trying to score enough points to finish the class...which brings me to grading.\nOn grading, there were questions present on homeworks and exams that could have been based on information that wasn\'t in the printed notes, but touched on during lecture for about five seconds. When lectured on in detail, some of the presentation methods could be construed to be contradictory (or flat-out wrong in a couple of cases) and required confirmation in the human-led sessions. When it came time for the exam (or sometimes even the homeworks), god forbid if your flashcards or whatever memorization method failed you in that time period you immediately lost 1-4% from your final grade.\nOne could argue that every part of the class design achieved the needs and objectives, and full disclosure the final score was a mid-B. But looking back, I\'ve completely forgotten some 80% of the course material and paid some good money only to have for three credit hours and traumatic memories to show for it. If Dr. Jayaraman\'s argument of a happy customers being the most important part of a business\'s survival holds true, this class needs a complete overhaul to deliver a more positive, conducive learning experience.','Hard','Strongly Disliked','8 hours/week');
